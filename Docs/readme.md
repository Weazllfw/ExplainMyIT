Explain My IT — Marketing Site v1

Canonical Product & SEO Specification

1. Canonical Product Definition (LOCKED)

Explain My IT is a plain-English IT reality report for business owners.

It explains what a company’s IT setup actually means, using publicly observable information, without jargon, dashboards, monitoring, or fixes.

Explain My IT is NOT:

Not a managed service

Not monitoring

Not a security tool

Not remediation

Not an MSP replacement

Not continuous

Explain My IT IS:

A clarity product

A reality translation layer

A finite report

Owner-readable

Calm, factual, and non-judgmental

This definition must appear (in some form) on the site.

2. Target Audience (For Copy + SEO Alignment)

Primary ICP:

SMB owners / founders / managing partners

Ops-led or finance-led businesses

~10–150 employees

“IT exists, but I don’t fully understand it”

Secondary readers:

CFOs

COOs

Insurance brokers

M&A advisors

Explicitly NOT targeting:

MSPs

IT admins

Security teams

Enterprises

This affects tone, language, and keywords.

3. Site Goal (v1 Only)

The site has one job:

Clearly explain what Explain My IT is, who it’s for, and build trust while collecting early interest.

No scan yet. No tools. No accounts.

Primary CTA:

“Join early access”

or “Get notified when reports launch”

Secondary CTA (optional, footer):

“Contact”

4. Required Pages (v1)
4.1 Homepage (/)

This is the only required page for launch.

Hero Section (Above the Fold)

H1 (single H1, non-negotiable):

Explain My IT

H2 / Subheadline:

Plain-English IT reality reports for business owners.

Body copy (short):

Your business runs on IT — but it’s rarely explained in language owners can actually understand.

Explain My IT produces a calm, readable report that explains what your IT setup means, using publicly observable information.

No jargon. No dashboards. No fixes. Just clarity.

Primary CTA:

Join Early Access

Section: “Who This Is For”

Bullet points, owner-language only.

Example:

Business owners who rely on IT but don’t live in it

Companies with internal IT or an MSP

Owners preparing for insurance, growth, or transitions

Anyone who has ever thought: “I don’t actually know how this works”

Avoid technical terms entirely.

Section: “What This Is Not” (Very Important for Trust)

This section reduces friction and anxiety.

Example bullets:

Not monitoring

Not a security audit

Not a managed service

Not remediation

Not continuous access

Follow with:

Explain My IT exists to explain, not to manage or sell fixes.

This section is critical. Do not soften it.

Section: “What You Get”

Describe the artifact, not features.

Example:

A written report, not a dashboard

Clear explanations of what matters and why

Business-level risks and assumptions

No blame, no fear, no upsell

Optional line:

Think of it as an owner-level memo, not an IT tool.

Section: “How It Works” (High Level, No Scan Yet)

Even without the free tier live, set expectation.

Example:

We review publicly observable IT signals

We interpret them using an owner-first lens

You receive a plain-English report

No promises about timelines or pricing yet.

5. SEO: FULL CHECKLIST (DO NOT SKIP)

This is the most important section.

5.1 Technical SEO (Build-Time)

Must be implemented from day one.

https enforced

Canonical URL set on every page

One URL variant only (www or non-www — pick one)

robots.txt present and permissive

XML sitemap (/sitemap.xml)

Proper meta viewport

Clean URLs (no query junk)

5.2 Page Metadata (Homepage)

5.3 Heading Structure

Logical H2 sections

No skipped heading levels

Do not use headings for styling only

5.4 Structured Data (Very Important)

Implement JSON-LD:

Organization schema

name: Explain My IT

url: https://explainmyit.com

logo (can be placeholder)

contactPoint (email)

SoftwareApplication schema (even if “report service”)

name: Explain My IT

applicationCategory: BusinessApplication

description: plain-English IT reports for business owners

offers: price = 0 (for now, free / coming soon)

This helps Google understand what you are early.

5.5 Performance / Core Web Vitals

Static or SSR rendering

No heavy JS on homepage

Optimized images only

Avoid third-party scripts initially

This matters more than platform choice.

5.6 Content SEO (Foundational)

Primary keyword themes:

“IT explained for business owners”

“understand my IT”

“IT clarity for owners”

“IT reality report”

“business owner IT understanding”

Do not chase “cybersecurity” or “monitoring” keywords.

This site should signal clarity, not defense.

5.7 Indexing Setup

Google Search Console set up day 1

Sitemap submitted

Analytics (lightweight: Plausible or GA)

Conversion event: early access signup

6. Tone & Copy Rules (Pass to Cursor)

Hard rules for all copy:

Write for non-technical readers

Use complete sentences

Avoid acronyms unless explained

No fear language

No vendor mentions

No “AI” hype

Calm, factual, adult tone

If a sentence sounds like an MSP blog, delete it.

7. What Is Explicitly Out of Scope (v1)

Do NOT build:

Scan UI

Domain input

Accounts

Login

Pricing pages

PDF export

Branding rabbit holes

Note: Blog IS included in v1 MVP for content marketing and SEO.

This is a marketing clarity page with educational blog content.

8. Success Criteria for v1

A business owner understands the product in under 30 seconds

No one asks “is this monitoring?”

People are willing to give an email

You don’t need to rewrite it when the free scan launches
