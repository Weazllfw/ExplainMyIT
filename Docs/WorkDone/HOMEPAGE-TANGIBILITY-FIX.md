# Homepage Tangibility Fix - Complete ✅

**Date**: January 29, 2026  
**Issue**: Page answered "Is this credible?" well, but under-answered "What do I actually receive?"

---

## Core Problem

**Current state**: Page communicates features and benefits  
**User question**: "What artifact lands in my inbox after 60 seconds?"

**Gap**: Owners don't want features — they want **tangible deliverables**

---

## The Fix (3 Surgical Changes)

### ✅ **1. Hero Section - Added Tangibility Sentence**

**Before**:
```
"Get a free snapshot of your IT setup in plain English. No credit card required."
[End of hero copy]
```

**After**:
```
"Get a free snapshot of your IT setup in plain English. No credit card required."

"You'll receive a short, plain-English report explaining what your IT setup 
appears to be, what it's assuming, and what questions are worth asking."
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Mentions **report** (tangible artifact)
- ✅ Mentions **assumptions** (your differentiator)
- ✅ Mentions **questions** (empowering, not scary)
- ✅ Still non-technical
- ✅ Sets clear expectations

---

### ✅ **2. "What's In Your Free Snapshot" - Added Framing Sentence**

**Before**:
```
What's In Your Free Snapshot
[4 cards showing sections]
```

**After**:
```
What's In Your Free Snapshot

"Your free snapshot includes a short owner-readable report 
made up of the following sections:"

[4 cards showing sections]
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Cards now feel like **pages in a report** (not marketing tiles)
- ✅ Word "report" reinforces deliverable
- ✅ "Owner-readable" reinforces audience
- ✅ "Made up of the following" → concrete contents

---

### ✅ **3. Added "What This Snapshot Is/Isn't" Clarifier Section**

**NEW SECTION** (placed after snapshot contents, before "Who It's For"):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What This Snapshot Is                                   │
│ A one-time, external view of your IT setup based only  │
│ on publicly observable signals.                         │
│                                                         │
│ It explains what your current setup appears to be       │
│ doing, not how to fix it.                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What This Snapshot Isn't                                │
│ It doesn't scan your network, access your systems,     │
│ or change anything.                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Example: "Your email protection is partially           │
│ configured, which means someone could impersonate your │
│ company unless additional controls are in place. This  │
│ is common in small businesses and is usually handled   │
│ by internal IT or an MSP."                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Eliminates "Is this a scan?" fear
- ✅ Eliminates "Is this invasive?" concern
- ✅ Eliminates "Will this break something?" worry
- ✅ **Example** anchors expectations without fear
- ✅ Short (2-3 lines each box)
- ✅ Calm, factual tone

---

### ✅ **Bonus: Form Card Subheading**

**Before**:
```
Get Your Free IT Snapshot
See what your IT setup actually means, explained in plain English
```

**After**:
```
Get Your Free IT Snapshot
Results delivered to your email in 30-60 seconds
```

**Why**: More concrete about delivery mechanism and timing

---

## What We Did NOT Change

🚫 **Didn't** add technical checks list  
🚫 **Didn't** show raw data  
🚫 **Didn't** say "security" repeatedly  
🚫 **Didn't** add scores or grades  
🚫 **Didn't** say "risk assessment"  

**We're selling understanding, not analysis.**

---

## The Positioning Test

**If a business owner leaves the page thinking:**

> "I'll get a short, readable explanation of what my IT setup looks like from the outside, what it's assuming, and what questions I should ask."

**Then Tier 1 is perfectly clear.** ✅

---

## Files Modified (1 File)

1. ✅ `app/page.tsx` - 4 surgical changes:
   - Hero: Added tangibility sentence
   - Snapshot section: Added framing sentence
   - NEW: "What This Snapshot Is/Isn't" section

---

## Copy Breakdown (Word-for-Word)

### Hero Addition (New Paragraph)
```
You'll receive a short, plain-English report explaining what 
your IT setup appears to be, what it's assuming, and what 
questions are worth asking.
```

### Snapshot Section Framing (New Sentence)
```
Your free snapshot includes a short owner-readable report 
made up of the following sections:
```

### Clarifier Section (New)

**What This Snapshot Is**:
```
A one-time, external view of your IT setup based only on 
publicly observable signals.

It explains what your current setup appears to be doing, 
not how to fix it.
```

**What This Snapshot Isn't**:
```
It doesn't scan your network, access your systems, or 
change anything.
```

**Example**:
```
"Your email protection is partially configured, which means 
someone could impersonate your company unless additional 
controls are in place. This is common in small businesses 
and is usually handled by internal IT or an MSP."
```

### Form Card Subheading (Changed)
```
Results delivered to your email in 30-60 seconds
```

## Impact

### Before (Abstract)
- "Get insights into your IT"
- "Track changes over time"
- "Dashboard view"

**User thinks**: *"What exactly am I getting?"*

### After (Concrete)
- "You'll receive a **short, plain-English report**"
- "Made up of the following **sections**"
- "**Example**: Your email protection is partially configured..."

**User thinks**: *"Oh, I'm getting a report with these specific sections that looks like this example. Got it."*

---

## Brand Consistency

All new copy maintains:
- ✅ **"Insights, not alerts"** tone
- ✅ **Owner-first** language (not IT-focused)
- ✅ **Calm, factual** presentation
- ✅ **Translation, not jargon** principle
- ✅ Brand colors and styling

---

## Next Step (Optional Enhancement)

We could also update the **report page itself** to match these expectations 1:1:
- Add "This report is based on publicly observable signals" note
- Add "What we checked" expandable section
- Add "What we didn't check" note

Let me know if you want that too!

---

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Tier 1 artifact is now tangible, not abstract!

**Result**: User now knows **exactly** what they're getting in 60 seconds.
