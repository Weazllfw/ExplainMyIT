## Legal Review Recommendations

### ⚠️ Before Launch - Required Action
**Line 374 in Terms of Service needs updating:**

```tsx
// Currently:
These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the United States and the State of [Your State]...

// Update to actual state:
These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the United States and the State of [Delaware/California/etc.]...
```

**Action required**: Choose jurisdiction (typically where business is registered or primary operations)

### 💡 Optional Professional Review
While these Terms are comprehensive and protective, consider:
- Having a lawyer review for your specific jurisdiction
- Verifying arbitration clause compliance in your state
- Confirming class action waiver enforceability
- Reviewing liability caps for your business model

**Note**: These Terms provide strong protection but are not a substitute for professional legal counsel.
