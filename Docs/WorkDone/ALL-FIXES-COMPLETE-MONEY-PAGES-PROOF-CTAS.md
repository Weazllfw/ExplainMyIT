# ALL FIXES COMPLETE - Money Pages, Proof Content & Dual CTAs

**Date**: 2026-01-31  
**Status**: ✅ ALL THREE FIXES IMPLEMENTED

---

## Fix #3: 3 Money Pages Created ✅

### Pages Created
1. **`/use-cases`** - 4 specific scenarios (insurance, acquisition, MSP transition, ownership)
2. **`/examples`** - 2 redacted example reports with real-looking snapshots
3. **`/why-monthly`** - The "drift" narrative in one page

### Supporting Updates
- ✅ Sitemap updated (all 3 pages added, priorities set)
- ✅ Footer navigation updated (Product section now has 5 links)
- ✅ Metadata and SEO for all 3 pages
- ✅ CTAs on all 3 pages (both free and paid paths)

### Strategic Purpose
**These are conversion targets**: Every blog post will link to these pages contextually

---

## Fix #4: "Proof" Content Category Added ✅

### 3 New Articles Added to Calendar

**Week 14 (May 10)**: "What a Normal Small Business IT Footprint Looks Like"
- Maps directly to report experience
- Builds credibility ("we've seen hundreds of setups")
- Sets expectations for snapshots

**Week 15 (May 17)**: "Common Domain Ownership Mistakes We See"  
- Social proof through real examples
- Practical value (how to fix)
- Establishes expertise

**Week 16 (May 24)**: "Assumptions Business Owners Make (That Turn Out Wrong)"  
- **HIGHEST CONVERSION POTENTIAL**
- Directly challenges reader assumptions
- Motivates immediate snapshot request

### Why Proof Content Works
- Makes product concrete and relatable
- Shows you've actually done this
- Builds trust through specificity
- Maps to actual report experience
- Converts skeptics who think "we're probably fine"

---

## Fix #5: Dual CTA Structure Implemented ✅

### All 12 Blog Seed Articles Updated

**New CTA block** (inserted between closing paragraph and related reading):

```markdown
---

**Ready to see your IT setup?**

🎯 **[Run your free snapshot →](/pricing)** — See your current configuration in 60 seconds

📅 **Want this monthly with full history?** [See Basic subscription →](/pricing) ($15/month)

---
```

### Why This Works

✅ **Two clear paths**: Free entry + paid option  
✅ **Training effect**: Every article mentions "monthly with history"  
✅ **Non-pushy**: Secondary CTA is informational link, not hard sell  
✅ **Consistent**: Same format across all articles  
✅ **Strategic**: Positions monthly as natural progression, not upsell  

### The Psychology
- Primary CTA: Low-friction (free, 60 seconds)
- Secondary CTA: "Want this monthly" (implies monthly is normal/expected)
- Reader learns: Free = once, Basic = monthly recurring
- **No**: "Upgrade" or "Premium" language (sounds expensive)
- **Yes**: "Want this monthly" (sounds like logical next step)

### Blog → Money Pages (To Be Added)
**Contextual inline links within article body**:

**From problem articles → /use-cases**:
- Inherited IT → "like this [insurance renewal scenario](/use-cases#insurance-renewal)"
- Security article → "especially during [insurance renewals](/use-cases)"

**From all articles → /examples**:
- When discussing reports → "see [example reports](/examples)"
- When questioning "what will I get" → "[Here's what snapshots look like](/examples)"

**From dated records article → /why-monthly**:
- When discussing frequency → "This is [why monthly](/why-monthly) matters"
- When discussing comparison → "Read more about [monthly snapshots](/why-monthly)"

**Target**: Add 2-3 money page links per blog article (24-36 total links)

### Money Pages → Blog
Each money page already links to relevant blog articles:
- Use Cases → Inherited IT, Security, Dated Records
- Examples → Audit guide, Quarterly checklist
- Why Monthly → Dated Records, Audit, Quarterly Review
