## Overview

These refinements add strategic precision without hype. Each change clarifies the product nature, sets correct expectations, and reinforces decision-moment framing.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Hero Section - Product Framing ✅

**Added explicit product line:**

**Before**:
```
Plain-English IT reports for business owners.
Understand your IT reality in simple terms. No jargon. No tech talk. Just clarity.
```

**After**:
```
Plain-English IT reports for business owners.

No jargon. No tech talk. Just clarity.

A simple dashboard and recurring reports that explain 
what your IT setup actually means.
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Confirms it's an ongoing product
- ✅ Confirms there is a dashboard
- ✅ Keeps focus on explanation, not tooling
- ✅ No hype, just precision

**CTA Updated**: "Get Early Access to the Dashboard"

---

### 2. Dashboard Visual Enhancement ✅

**Added explicit label to mockup:**

Added badge: `Owner Dashboard` above "Public Snapshot"

**Impact**:
- ✅ Reinforces "I log in, I see a dashboard"
- ✅ Clarifies this is for owners
- ✅ Makes product nature immediately visible

---

### 3. "Who It's For" - Decision Context ✅

**Reframed from audience types to decision moments:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Business owners who want clarity" | "Business owners who rely on IT but don't want to live in it" |
| "Companies with internal IT or an MSP" | "Companies with internal IT or an MSP who want independent, owner-level clarity" |
| "Preparing for insurance or transitions" | "Preparing for insurance, growth, audits, or transitions" |

**Impact**:
- ✅ Owners recognize decision moments instantly
- ✅ More specific use cases
- ✅ "Independent, owner-level clarity" reinforces positioning
- ✅ Added "audits" and "growth" as explicit triggers

---

### 4. "What It's Not" - Guardrail Sentence ✅

**Added clarifying boundary:**

**New sentence at end:**
```
Explain My IT shows you what's happening — 
it doesn't run or change your systems.
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Clear product boundary
- ✅ No operational responsibility
- ✅ No MSP overlap confusion
- ✅ Critical for expectation management

---

### 5. "What You Get" - Product Outputs (Major Reframe) ✅

**Changed from SaaS features to product outputs:**

#### Card 1: Dashboard
**Before**: "Owner-friendly interface"  
**After**: "A simple owner dashboard"

**Copy**: "Clear summaries of your IT environment, written for decision-makers — not technicians."

#### Card 2: Reports
**Before**: "Business-level insights"  
**After**: "Recurring plain-English reports"

**Copy**: "Automatic snapshots that explain risks, assumptions, and changes over time."

#### Card 3: Explanations
**Before**: "No jargon"  
**After**: "Business-level explanations"

**Copy**: "What matters, why it matters, and what could surprise you — without technical noise."

#### Card 4: Presentation
**Before**: "No blame, no fear"  
**After**: "Calm, factual presentation"

**Copy**: "No blame. No fear. No upsell. Just explanation."

**Icons Updated**: More product-appropriate (dashboard, document, checkmark, inbox)

**Impact**:
- ✅ Reads as what owner experiences
- ✅ Firmly in "product" territory
- ✅ Preserves calm tone
- ✅ Clear recurring nature
- ✅ Automatic snapshots mentioned

---

### 6. Usage Expectation Sentence ✅

**Added at bottom of "What You Get":**

```
Most customers use Explain My IT as a background tool — 
checking in periodically, not daily.
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Reduces support expectations
- ✅ Reinforces "low effort / low noise"
- ✅ Aligns with pricing model
- ✅ Sets correct engagement pattern

---

## Key Positioning Shifts

### From → To

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Product Type** | Unclear if one-off or recurring | Explicitly: dashboard + recurring reports |
| **Audience** | Generic types | Decision moments and contexts |
| **Boundaries** | Implied | Explicit: "doesn't run or change systems" |
| **Outputs** | Feature-like | Product outputs owner experiences |
| **Usage** | Unspecified | "Background tool, periodic checking" |
| **Dashboard** | Mentioned but vague | Front and center, labeled clearly |

---

## Strategic Outcomes

### Product Clarity
- ✅ Visitors immediately understand: dashboard + reports
- ✅ "Ongoing product" not "one-off service"
- ✅ Clear recurring nature

### Expectation Management
- ✅ Not a monitoring tool (it observes, doesn't change)
- ✅ Background tool (periodic, not daily)
- ✅ Owner-focused (not IT-focused)

### Decision Triggers
- ✅ Insurance, growth, audits, transitions
- ✅ "Independent, owner-level clarity"
- ✅ "Don't want to live in IT"

### Differentiation
- ✅ vs. MSPs: "doesn't run or change systems"
- ✅ vs. Monitoring: "background tool, periodic"
- ✅ vs. Technical dashboards: "for decision-makers, not technicians"
