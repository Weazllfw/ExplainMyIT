# Pricing Strategy - v1 Launch

**Decision Date**: January 28, 2026  
**Status**: Intentionally deferred

---

## Strategic Decision: NO Full Pricing in v1

### What We're NOT Doing

❌ Full pricing table  
❌ Dollar amounts  
❌ Tier breakdown  
❌ Feature comparison grid  
❌ "Buy now" or payment flows  

### What We ARE Doing

✅ Soft pricing acknowledgement  
✅ Signal: subscription-based  
✅ Signal: simple and background spend  
✅ Keep focus on understanding, not buying  

---

## Rationale

### 1. Haven't Earned the Price Yet

**The value moment happens AFTER someone uses the product:**
> "Oh, this explains things I didn't realize I didn't understand."

Right now, visitors haven't had that moment yet.

**Pricing before value = mental friction.**

### 2. Still Validating Mental Models

**Open questions we'll answer with free tier:**
- Do users think of this as "insurance-like" or "software-like"?
- Do they expect monthly, quarterly, or "whenever I want"?
- Do they mentally anchor it to $10, $30, or $100?

**Publishing pricing now locks us into assumptions we don't need to make yet.**

### 3. Early Pricing Scares Off Right Users

**Owner/CFO/Ops reaction patterns:**
- If price shown early → "I'll decide later" (postponement)
- If price absent but reasonable → "I'll see what this is" (curiosity)

**For a clarity product, curiosity is our strongest lever.**

## Implementation (v1)

### Location 1: Footer (Subtle)

Under "Pricing" section:
```
Simple, subscription-based, designed to stay 
in the background of normal business software spend.
```

### Location 2: Waitlist Form (Reassurance)

Below form:
```
Pricing will be simple, subscription-based, and designed 
to stay in the background of normal business software spend.
```

### Navigation: No "Pricing" Link

Header navigation deliberately excludes pricing link to avoid:
- Creating expectation of full pricing page
- Driving traffic to empty/stub content
- Anchoring price discussions prematurely

---

## When to Publish Real Pricing

**Publish after one of these is true:**
- 10-20 people have used the free snapshot
- We've seen what questions they ask after results
- We've felt what they mentally compare us to
- We've had at least one "this would be worth paying for" message

**At that point, pricing becomes obvious instead of theoretical.**

---

## Exception Case (Not Applicable to Us)

**Full pricing up front would matter IF we were:**
- Running ads
- Doing outbound sales
- Selling into procurement

**But we're doing:**
- Inbound
- SEO
- Curiosity-driven discovery

**So ambiguity helps us right now.**

## Messaging Principles

### What to Say
✅ "Subscription-based"  
✅ "Simple pricing"  
✅ "Background spend"  
✅ "No per-seat pricing"  
✅ "No contracts"  
✅ "Cancel anytime"  

### What NOT to Say
❌ Specific dollar amounts  
❌ "Starting at..."  
❌ Tier names (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)  
❌ Feature gating by tier  
❌ "Limited time" or urgency  
❌ "Free forever" (sets wrong expectation)  

---

## Positioning vs. Pricing

### Current Site Goal (v1)
**Positioning and trust, NOT conversion to purchase.**

The job hierarchy:
1. Explain what the product is ✅
2. Build trust with calm tone ✅
3. Collect early interest ✅
4. Show value through free tier ⏳ (next)
5. Present pricing 🔜 (after #4)

**We're at step 3. Pricing is step 5.**

---

## Competitive Note

### Traditional SaaS Approach
- Homepage → Features → Pricing → Trial → Purchase

### Our Approach (Clarity Product)
- Homepage → Understanding → Free tier → Value moment → Pricing becomes obvious

**This is not evasion. This is strategic sequencing.**

---

## Handling User Questions

### If someone asks "How much does it cost?"

**Pre-launch (now):**
> "Pricing will be announced when the free snapshot launches. It will be subscription-based, simple, and designed to stay in the background of normal business software spend."

**Post-free-tier:**
> "You can start with a free public snapshot. Paid tiers add [X, Y, Z]. Pricing starts at $[amount]/month."

---

## Future Pricing Page (v2)

### When to Build
After free tier is live and we have:
- User feedback on value
- Mental model clarity
- Anchor point data

### Structure (Preliminary)
1. **Pricing Philosophy** (no dollars yet)
   - Subscription-based
   - No per-seat
   - No contracts
   - Cancel anytime

2. **Tiers** (conceptual)
   - Free: Public snapshot
   - Paid: [Feature adds]

3. **Dollar Amounts** (when ready)
   - Simple, clear numbers
   - No "starting at" tricks
   - Annual option with savings

---

## Why This Decision Is Right

### We're Playing Long Game
- Building trust > Closing deals
- Understanding > Conversion
- Curiosity > Commitment

### We're Avoiding Traps
- Early anchoring (wrong price)
- Tier complexity (confusing)
- Feature gating (annoying)
- Procurement friction (wrong ICP)

### We're Earning Leverage
- Let value speak first
- Let users anchor themselves
- Let pricing become obvious

---

## Success Metrics (v1 Without Pricing)

**What we're measuring:**
- ✅ Email signups (curiosity)
- ✅ Blog readership (engagement)
- ✅ Time on site (understanding)
- ✅ Referral mentions (word of mouth)

**What we're NOT measuring:**
- ❌ Pricing page visits (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Upgrade intent (too early)
- ❌ Payment conversions (not available)

---

## Final Note

**This is not about hiding pricing.**  
**This is about sequencing value delivery correctly.**

For a clarity product, the right order is:
1. Curiosity
2. Understanding  
3. Experience
4. Value moment
5. Pricing

**We're at step 1-2. Pricing comes at step 5.**

**Not doing something is the right product decision here.**

---

## Review Trigger

**Re-evaluate this decision when:**
- Free tier goes live
- We have 10+ free tier users
- Users start asking "what's next?"
- We've collected value feedback

**Until then: hold the line on no pricing detail.**

**Decision: Confirmed ✅**  
**Implementation: Complete ✅**  
**Next review: After free tier launch 📅**
