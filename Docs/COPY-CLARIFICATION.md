## Important Product Clarification

### What We Learned

The initial copy was too anti-dashboard. The product DOES include a dashboard, but it's specifically designed for business owners and decision-makers, not IT teams.

### The Distinction

**NOT**: Technical monitoring dashboards with:
- Real-time alerts
- System metrics
- Uptime monitoring  
- Technical graphs and charts
- IT admin tools

**IS**: Owner-friendly dashboard with:
- Plain-English explanations
- Business-level insights
- Decision-maker interface
- Clarity and understanding
- What matters and why

### Updated Messaging

**Before**: "No dashboards"  
**After**: "Owner-friendly interface built for decision-makers"

**Before**: "A written report, not a dashboard"  
**After**: "Owner-friendly interface - Clear explanations built for decision-makers, not IT teams"

**Before**: "Plain-English summaries of your IT setup"  
**After**: "We build clarity tools for business owners — not monitoring dashboards for IT teams"

**Before**: "Think of it as an owner-level memo, not an IT tool"  
**After**: "An owner-friendly dashboard and reports that explain what matters — not technical metrics that confuse"

### Section: "What It's Not"

Updated to be more specific:
- "No monitoring alerts" (not "No monitoring")
- "No security scanning" (not "No security audits")
- "No tech jargon" (more specific)
- "No remediation services" (not "No upselling")

### Key Takeaway

The product provides:
1. **Dashboard** - But owner-focused, not IT-admin-focused
2. **Reports** - Plain-English explanations
3. **Interface** - Decision-maker friendly

The differentiation is:
- **Them**: Technical dashboards with metrics, alerts, monitoring
- **Us**: Business dashboards with explanations, clarity, understanding

### All Copy Updates Made

✅ Hero section - Removed "No dashboards"  
✅ "What It's Not" section - More specific about what we're not  
✅ "What You Get" section - Changed from "written report, not a dashboard" to "owner-friendly interface"

## For Future Reference

When describing the product:
- ✅ "Owner-friendly dashboard"
- ✅ "Built for business owners, not IT teams"
- ✅ "Clarity interface for decision-makers"
- ✅ "Dashboard that explains, not monitors"

Avoid:
- ❌ "No dashboards" (too broad)
- ❌ "Not a dashboard" (inaccurate)
- ❌ "Written reports only" (incomplete)

**The product IS a dashboard — just not the kind IT people expect.**
