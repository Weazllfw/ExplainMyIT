**Last Updated**: February 4, 2026  
**Purpose**: Guide for cold outreach and lead nurturing  
**Audience**: Email marketing freelancers

## 🎯 What You're Selling (In Plain English)

**ExplainMyIT** helps business owners understand their company's IT setup without needing to be technical.

### The One-Sentence Pitch
"We turn your IT setup into plain-English reports so you can understand what you have, what's assumed, and what questions are worth asking."

### The Problem We Solve
Business owners rely on IT but don't speak the language. They:
- Don't know what they don't know about their IT
- Can't tell if their IT provider is doing a good job
- Get blindsided when IT questions come up (insurance, audits, transitions)
- Have no dated record of how their IT was configured at any point in time

### The Solution
- **Free Snapshot**: One-time external view of their IT setup (domain, email security, website security, tech stack, breach history)
- **Basic Subscription**: $19.99/month for automatic monthly snapshots that create a timeline of changes
- **Plain English**: Everything explained for business owners, not IT professionals

## 🎯 Target Audience (Who to Reach Out To)

### Perfect Fit
1. **Business owners** (5-200 employees) who:
   - Rely on IT but aren't technical
   - Have an MSP or internal IT person
   - Are preparing for insurance, audits, M&A, or growth

   - Growth phase (investor questions about IT)
   - Someone technical just left the company

### NOT a Good Fit
❌ Don't waste time on:

- Anyone looking for security scanning or penetration testing
- Anyone wanting to replace their IT provider

## 💬 Messaging Guidelines

### Tone & Voice Rules
✅ **DO Use:**
- "Understand" (not "monitor")
- "Clarity" (not "security")
- "Dated record" (not "audit trail")
- "Plain English" (not "simplified")
- "Assumptions being made" (not "risks")
- "Questions to ask" (not "recommendations")
- "What changed" (not "what's wrong")

❌ **DON'T Use:**
- Fear language ("critical", "urgent", "severe", "exposed")
- Technical jargon unless explaining it
- "Monitoring" or "alerting" (we don't do that)
- "Compliance" (we're not a compliance tool)
- "Security scanning" (we're not a security tool)
- "Fix", "remediate", "patch" (we explain, not fix)

### Value Propositions (In Order of Impact)

"Get an outside view of your IT setup that isn't coming from the people running it."

"Finally understand what your IT actually means for your business, not just technical specs."

**3. Dated Records**
"IT changes quietly over time. Create a record of how things looked at each point in time."

**5. Preparedness**
"When questions come up (insurance, audits, transitions), have answers ready."

## 📧 Email Templates & Talking Points

### Cold Outreach Hook (Choose One)

**Option 1 - The Record Angle:**
"Most business owners have no idea how their IT was configured 6 months ago. When questions come up (insurance, audits, transitions), they're guessing. We create dated records in plain English."

**Option 2 - The Independence Angle:**
"You're relying on your IT provider to tell you what your IT provider is doing. That's a problem. We give you an independent view you can actually understand."

**Option 3 - The Clarity Angle:**
"IT conversations shouldn't feel like a foreign language. We explain what your setup means for your business—no certifications required."

**Option 4 - The Assumption Angle:**
"Your IT setup is making assumptions right now (about email security, website certificates, domain management). We tell you what those assumptions are so you can verify they're correct."

### Common Questions & How to Answer

**Q: "How is this different from what my MSP does?"**
A: "We're not replacing your MSP—we're giving you independent visibility into what they're managing. Think of it like getting a second opinion, except we're not making medical decisions, just helping you understand what you have."

**Q: "Is this a security tool?"**
A: "No, we're not a security scanner or monitoring service. We explain what your current setup looks like from the outside, in language you can understand. We don't send alerts, scan for vulnerabilities, or tell you what to fix."

**Q: "Do you access our network?"**
A: "No. We only look at publicly available information—the same things anyone on the internet could see (your domain registration, email security records, SSL certificates, tech stack). We never access your internal network or systems."

**Q: "What's the ROI?"**
A: "We're $19.99/month—less than an hour of your MSP's time. The ROI comes from avoiding surprises, being prepared when questions come up, and having an independent check on what you're being told about your IT."

**Q: "Can you tell me what to fix?"**
A: "We explain what we observe and what assumptions your setup is making, but we don't make recommendations or tell you what to fix. That's a conversation for you and your IT provider. We give you the clarity to have that conversation effectively."

**Q: "Will this work with our compliance needs?"**
A: "We create dated records in plain English that can support compliance documentation, but we're not a compliance tool. We explain what exists, not whether it meets specific standards."

**Q: "What if we find something concerning?"**
A: "Our reports use calm, factual language. We don't raise alarms or use fear tactics. We explain what we observe, what it means in business terms, and what assumptions are being made. Then you decide what (if anything) to do about it."

## 🚫 What NOT to Promise

### Never Say We Will:
- ❌ "Monitor your systems"
- ❌ "Alert you to problems"
- ❌ "Scan for vulnerabilities"
- ❌ "Ensure compliance"
- ❌ "Fix issues"
- ❌ "Replace your IT provider"
- ❌ "Provide 24/7 support"
- ❌ "Access your internal network"
- ❌ "Test your security"
- ❌ "Make recommendations"

### When They Ask for Something We Don't Do:
"That's not what we do, and honestly, we're intentionally not trying to be that. We're clarity and record-keeping for business owners, not [monitoring/security/remediation]. For [what they're asking for], you'd want [appropriate alternative]."

---

## 🎯 Objection Handling

### "We already have an MSP/IT person."
**Response:** "Perfect—we're designed for businesses that already have IT. We give you independent visibility into what they're managing so you can be an informed owner, not just trust blindly."

### "We don't have budget for more IT tools."
**Response:** "We're not an IT tool—we're a business owner tool. At $19.99/month, it's less than an hour of your MSP's time. Think of it as cheap insurance against being caught off guard when IT questions come up."

### "Our IT is simple, we don't need this."
**Response:** "That's actually when this is most valuable. Simple setups are where things get assumed and undocumented. When someone leaves or you need to answer questions, you'll wish you had dated records of how things were configured."

### "Can't we just ask our IT provider?"
**Response:** "You can, but you're asking the people running your IT to explain their own work. We give you an independent perspective you can actually understand, so you know what questions to ask them."

### "We're too busy right now."
**Response:** "The free snapshot takes 60 seconds and requires zero follow-up. If it's useful, great. If not, you're out nothing. The paid version runs automatically in the background—you check in when you need it, not daily."

### "This feels like something we should do later."
**Response:** "The whole point is creating dated records. Later doesn't help when someone asks 'how was this configured 6 months ago?' Start now, check back in 3 months, and you'll have a timeline."

### "We need to think about it."
**Response:** "Completely fair. The free snapshot is there whenever you're ready—no strings attached. If you want to see what it looks like first, just put in your domain and you'll have a report in 60 seconds."

## 📊 Use Cases & Stories

### Use Case 1: Insurance Renewal
**Scenario:** Business owner gets cyber insurance questionnaire asking about email security (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). They have no idea.

**How We Help:** Our report explains exactly what they have configured, in language they can understand. They can answer insurance questions confidently or forward the report to their insurance agent.

### Use Case 2: MSP Transition
**Scenario:** Business owner is unhappy with current MSP and interviewing new ones. Everyone says different things about what's currently configured.

**How We Help:** Independent dated record shows exactly what the setup looked like before the transition. New MSP can see what they're inheriting. No "he said, she said."

### Use Case 3: Inherited IT Setup
**Scenario:** New business owner bought a company and has no idea what IT infrastructure they inherited. Previous owner isn't being helpful.

**How We Help:** Get a baseline understanding of what exists, what's assumed, and what questions to ask. No longer flying blind.

### Use Case 4: Quiet IT Changes
**Scenario:** SSL certificate expired without warning. Business owner didn't know it was expiring, didn't know who was responsible for renewal.

**How We Help:** Monthly snapshots show certificate expiry dates, create a record of who was responsible, and help avoid future surprises.

### Use Case 5: Due Diligence
**Scenario:** Investor or buyer wants to understand IT infrastructure as part of due diligence.

**How We Help:** Dated records in business language that non-technical people can review. Shows configuration history, not just current state.

## 📈 Lead Qualification Questions

Ask these to qualify leads before heavy follow-up:

1. **"Do you currently have someone managing your IT?"** (If no, they need an MSP first)
2. **"How many domains does your business operate?"** (Helps gauge fit and pricing)
3. **"Have you recently dealt with insurance, audits, or due diligence questions about IT?"** (High-intent trigger)
4. **"Do you feel like you understand your current IT setup?"** (Pain point awareness)
5. **"When IT questions come up, do you have documented answers?"** (Problem recognition)

### Red Flags (Disqualify):
- They want security scanning or monitoring
- They're looking to replace their IT provider
- They're a tech company with internal IT expertise
- They want recommendations or remediation
- They have no IT budget whatsoever
- They're expecting 24/7 support

### Green Flags (High Priority):
- They've recently had IT questions come up and couldn't answer
- They're preparing for insurance, audit, or M&A
- They've recently hired/lost IT staff
- They're evaluating or transitioning MSPs
- They're non-technical but have IT questions regularly
- They mention wanting "peace of mind" or "independent view"

## 🔄 Nurture Sequence Suggestions

### Email 1 (Initial Contact):
**Subject:** "A dated record of your IT setup (in plain English)"

**Approach:** Problem awareness. Talk about IT changing quietly, questions coming up unexpectedly, relying on whoever's running IT to explain their own work.

**CTA:** Run free snapshot (60 seconds, no strings)

### Email 2 (3 days later):
**Subject:** "What your IT setup is assuming right now"

**Approach:** The assumptions angle. Email security, SSL certificates, domain management—everything is making assumptions. Do you know what they are?

**CTA:** Example report or free snapshot

### Email 3 (7 days later):
**Subject:** "When the insurance company asks about your IT..."

**Approach:** Real scenario. You get the cyber insurance questionnaire. What's SPF? What's DMARC? You're guessing or asking your IT provider.

**CTA:** See exactly what you have configured

### Email 4 (14 days later):
**Subject:** "Your IT, 6 months from now"

**Approach:** Time angle. Something will change in 6 months. Will you know what changed, when it changed, and why? Dated records matter.

**CTA:** Start creating a timeline for $19.99/month

### Email 5 (21 days later - Final):
**Subject:** "Independent IT visibility—yes or no?"

**Approach:** Direct. Either this resonates or it doesn't. If you want independent visibility, we're here. If not, no hard feelings.

**CTA:** Free snapshot or unsubscribe
