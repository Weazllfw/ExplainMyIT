Explain My IT — Tier 1 (Free)
Public Snapshot — Locked Specification
Tier intent

Tier 1 exists to:

demonstrate value immediately

surface real, defensible owner-level risks

build trust through honesty

create a natural upgrade path to recurring reports

It is not a teaser toy.
It is a legitimate snapshot with clear boundaries.

1. Scope (Hard Boundary)

Included

Publicly observable signals only

One-time snapshot per domain

Results shown in dashboard + emailed summary

Owner-readable explanations

Explicitly excluded

Internal access

Credentials

Continuous monitoring

Remediation

Deep vulnerability scanning

Aggressive port scanning

This scope must be stated clearly in the UI.

2. External APIs (Final Decision)
✅ Included

Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)
Domain-level breach exposure checks
→ This is worth the money and high trust.

❌ Excluded (for now)

Shodan (too expensive, overkill for Tier 1)

VirusTotal (too noisy)

BuiltWith paid tiers

Any exploit databases

You can add Shodan later behind paid tiers if and only if it adds owner value, not raw data.

3. Tier 1 Signal Blocks (Final List)

These are the only blocks Tier 1 runs.

Each block:

produces facts

computes simple flags

feeds the LLM

renders a dashboard card

Block A — Domain & DNS Overview

Raw signals

Domain age

Registrar

Nameservers

A / AAAA records

MX records

DNS hosting provider (inferred)

Derived flags

domain_age_low (e.g. < 1 year)

dns_provider_third_party

single_point_dns_dependency

Owner narrative focus

“Who controls your domain”

“How long this domain has existed”

“Whether DNS management is centralized or fragmented”

Block B — Email & Identity Posture (High-Value)

Raw signals

MX provider (Google / Microsoft / other)

SPF record presence & strictness

DKIM presence

DMARC policy (none / monitor / enforce)

Derived flags

email_spoofing_possible

email_protection_partial

email_protection_strong

Owner narrative focus

“Can someone impersonate your company by email?”

“Does your setup meet modern expectations?”

“This is commonly checked by insurers and vendors.”

This is one of your strongest Tier 1 sections.

Block C — Website & TLS / SSL

Raw signals

HTTPS enforced

Certificate issuer

Certificate expiry

TLS versions supported

Derived flags

ssl_expiring_soon

legacy_tls_supported

no_https_redirect

Owner narrative focus

“Is your website connection modern and trusted?”

“Are visitors exposed to browser warnings?”

“This affects trust, not just security.”

Block D — Website Technology & Hosting

Raw signals

CMS / framework (WordPress, Shopify, custom, etc.)

CDN presence

Hosting provider inference

Server headers

Derived flags

cms_common_target

custom_stack

hosting_dependency

Owner narrative focus

“What your website is built on”

“Who is responsible for updates”

“Whether this is common, aging, or bespoke”

No version numbers. No plugin lists.

Block E — Public Exposure (Constrained)

Raw signals

Presence of common public services:

80 / 443

22 (SSH)

3389 (RDP)

21 (FTP)

25 (SMTP)

Single IP only

Very shallow scan

Derived flags

remote_access_exposed

admin_service_public

public_service_unusual_for_smb

Owner narrative focus

“What services are reachable from the internet”

“Whether this is common or noteworthy”

“This is about exposure, not confirmation of compromise”

Careful, calm wording.

Block F — Brand & Reputation Signals (HIBP)

Raw signals

Domain present in known breach corpuses (HIBP)

Derived flags

domain_seen_in_breach_data

Owner narrative focus

“Your domain has appeared in known breach data”

“This does not mean you were hacked”

“It means exposure exists and should be understood”

Tone discipline is critical here.

4. Cross-Block Derived Insights (Tier 1)

These are computed + narrated, not raw.

Deterministic insight flags (computed pre-LLM)

Examples:

Email impersonation risk = DMARC missing + permissive SPF

External attack surface elevated = admin service + no email protection

Trust risk = website issues + brand exposure

Assumption risk = reliance on third parties without clear ownership

These flags are passed to the LLM.

LLM-generated insight categories (Tier 1 only)

The LLM produces:

Owner Summary

4–6 sentences

Calm, factual

“Here’s what this setup implies”

Top Findings (3 max)

Ranked by business relevance

Not technical severity

Assumptions Being Made

e.g. “The business is assuming X is configured correctly”

This is a signature Explain My IT concept

Questions to Ask Your IT / MSP

3–5 owner-safe questions

No instructions

No remediation steps. No fixes.

5. Dashboard Structure (Tier 1)
Sections (fixed order)

Owner Summary

Top Findings

Assumptions Being Made

Questions to Ask

Detail Cards (one per block)

Detail Card format

Title

2–4 sentence explanation

“Why this matters”

Confidence level (High / Medium / Low)

No raw tables. Ever.

6. LLM Prompt Guardrails (Locked)

Include these rules explicitly:

Write for business owners, not IT staff

Explain risk in business terms

Name exposed services, not exploits

Do not include CVE IDs

Do not include remediation steps

Do not recommend vendors

Avoid fear language

Use uncertainty where appropriate

This protects positioning and liability.

7. Tier 1 Output Promise (What the User Should Feel)

After reading Tier 1, the owner should think:

“I understand my public IT exposure better than before,
and I know what questions to ask — without feeling panicked.”

If they feel:

scared → too aggressive

confused → too technical

underwhelmed → too shallow

You adjust narrative, not data.
