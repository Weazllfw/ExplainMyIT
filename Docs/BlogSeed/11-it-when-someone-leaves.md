# What Happens to Your IT When Someone Leaves Your Company

An employee just gave notice. Maybe they're leaving on good terms, maybe not. Either way, you're thinking about transition plans, exit interviews, and knowledge transfer.

But there's something else that needs to happen, often faster than you'd think: you need to manage their IT access.

Even employees who leave on excellent terms shouldn't retain access to your business systems after they're gone. And employees who leave on bad terms definitely shouldn't.

Here's what needs to happen to your IT when someone leaves your company.

## Why This Matters

**Security risk:**  
Former employees with access to your systems can - intentionally or accidentally - cause problems. They can access information, make changes, or simply create security vulnerabilities.

**Compliance:**  
Many regulations require you to promptly remove access for former employees. "We forgot" isn't an acceptable answer during an audit.

**License costs:**  
You're often paying per-user for services. Inactive accounts still count. Remove them, save money.

**Data hygiene:**  
Orphaned accounts clutter your systems and make it harder to know who actually has access.

**Protection for them:**  
If something goes wrong with your systems and a former employee still has access, they might be blamed. Removing access protects everyone.

## The Timeline

**Last day of work:**  
Revoke access to critical systems. They shouldn't be able to access anything sensitive after their last day.

**Within 24 hours:**  
Revoke access to all business systems. Change any passwords they knew.

**Within 1 week:**  
Audit all systems to ensure no access remains. Transfer ownership of anything they controlled.

**Within 1 month:**  
Complete documentation of what access was removed and what was transitioned.

This isn't about trust. It's about proper security practices. Even your most trusted former employee shouldn't have access to your business systems after they leave.

## The Access Revocation Checklist

When someone leaves, systematically revoke their access:

### Email Account
- Remove their ability to log in
- Set up email forwarding if needed (to their manager or a role account)
- Eventually delete the account or convert to a shared mailbox
- Remove them from email distribution lists
- Update any auto-responders or signatures they set up

**Don't immediately delete:**  
You might need to forward their emails or access information for a transition period. Remove login access, but keep the account accessible to appropriate people.

### Website & CMS Access
- Remove their login to your website admin panel
- Remove their authoring/editing access
- Check if they created any admin accounts you don't know about
- Verify they can't access via FTP, SFTP, or other backend methods

### Domain & Hosting
- Remove their access to your domain registrar
- Remove their access to hosting control panels
- Check if they had SSH access to servers
- Verify they're not listed as admin contacts

### Cloud Services
- Google Workspace / Microsoft 365: Remove user, transfer file ownership
- Cloud storage (Dropbox, Box, etc.): Remove access, transfer ownership
- Project management tools: Remove account, reassign tasks
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams, etc.): Deactivate account
- Any other cloud services your business uses

### Financial Systems
- Accounting software access
- Payment processor access
- Banking system access (if they had any)
- Expense reporting systems

### Social Media & Marketing
- Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram business account access
- Email marketing platform access
- Analytics platforms
- Advertising account access

### Developer & Technical Access
- GitHub, GitLab, or other code repositories
- API keys they may have generated
- SSH keys on servers
- Database access
- Any technical accounts or access they had

### Physical Access
- Return of company computers, phones, or equipment
- Remote wipe of company data from devices they're keeping
- Removal from VPN access
- Deactivation of any security keys or tokens

### Two-Factor Authentication
- If they were the 2FA contact for any accounts, change this immediately
- Remove their phone number from any account recovery options
- Update security question answers they may have known

## The Transition: What They Controlled

Some employees didn't just have access - they controlled things. That's different, and harder to handle.

### Accounts Registered Under Their Email
If they registered business accounts using their personal email:
- Transfer these accounts to business email addresses
- Update contact information
- Update billing information

**This is why business accounts should never be registered under personal emails.**

### Domain or Services in Their Name
If your domain or hosting is registered under their name:
- Transfer ownership immediately
- This can be complex and time-sensitive
- Don't wait until they're hostile to start this process

### Things Only They Know
- Passwords they never shared
- Configuration details only in their head
- Vendor contacts only they know
- Processes only they documented (or didn't)

**This is why documentation and knowledge sharing matter.**

### Services on Their Credit Card
If business services are billed to their personal credit card:
- Transfer billing to a company account immediately
- Don't assume they'll keep paying for your services out of goodwill

## The Password Problem

If a departing employee knew admin passwords:
- Those passwords should be changed
- Even if you trust them completely
- Even if they left on excellent terms

**Passwords they may have known:**
- Email admin password
- Website admin password
- Domain registrar password
- Hosting account password
- Database passwords
- Social media account passwords
- Any shared account passwords

Change them all. Use a password manager going forward so individuals don't need to know passwords.

## The Knowledge Transfer

Before they leave (ideally with adequate notice):

**Document what they know:**
- What systems did they manage?
- What are the logins/passwords?
- Where is everything hosted?
- What are the processes?
- Who are the vendor contacts?
- What issues should we watch for?

**Transfer ownership:**
- Move domains from their account to company account
- Transfer ownership of files and documents
- Reassign admin roles to remaining staff
- Update contact information for all services

**Brief their replacement:**
- What will need attention after they leave?
- What are the quirks of your systems?
- What should the new person know?

This is infinitely easier if the employee is cooperative and has adequate notice. But it should happen even if they're not and don't.

## The Immediate Termination Scenario

If someone is terminated immediately (fired, not given notice):

**Minute 1:**  
Disable their primary accounts (email, computer login, VPN).

**Hour 1:**  
Revoke access to all business systems you can identify.

**Day 1:**  
Audit all systems for any remaining access. Change any passwords they knew.

**Week 1:**  
Complete the full access revocation checklist. Look for anything you might have missed.

This is harder than a planned departure, but it's necessary. Security can't wait for convenient timing.

## The Contractor or Vendor Scenario

When a contractor or vendor relationship ends, the same principles apply:

**What access did they have?**  
Often more than you realize. They may have:
- Admin access you gave them temporarily
- Accounts they created for their work
- API keys or credentials you don't know about

**Revoke it:**
- Disable their specific accounts
- Remove them from shared accounts
- Deactivate any credentials they generated
- Audit what they had access to

**Recover what they controlled:**
- If they registered things under their account, transfer them
- If they hosted things for you, migrate them to your control
- If only they know how something works, document it before they're gone

**This is why contractor access should be limited and temporary from the start.**

## The Audit After They Leave

One week after someone leaves, audit:

**What access remains?**  
Check every system. Did anything get missed?

**What did we learn?**  
What access did they have that we didn't realize? What should we do differently next time?

**What's documented?**  
Is everything they managed now documented for the next person?

**What's transferred?**  
Is ownership fully transferred from them to appropriate people?

This audit catches the things you forgot in the initial rush.

## Prevention: Doing This Right From the Start

The best time to plan for someone leaving is when they start:

**Use role accounts, not personal accounts**  
Don't register business services under personal emails. Use role-based accounts.

**Document everything**  
Don't let one person be the only one who knows how something works.

**Use a password manager**  
Individuals shouldn't know passwords. They should have access through proper authentication.

**Limit access appropriately**  
Only give access that's necessary for the job. Easier to revoke later.

**Regular access audits**  
Quarterly, review who has access to what. Remove unnecessary access proactively.

**Plan the transition**  
Before someone gives notice, you should already know what access they have and how you'd revoke it.

## The Checklist to Print

When someone leaves, check off:

- ☐ Email access disabled, forwarding configured if needed
- ☐ Website/CMS access removed
- ☐ Domain registrar access removed
- ☐ Hosting access removed
- ☐ Cloud service accounts disabled (Google/Microsoft/Dropbox/etc.)
- ☐ Financial system access removed
- ☐ Social media account access removed
- ☐ Marketing tool access removed
- ☐ Developer/technical access revoked
- ☐ VPN/network access disabled
- ☐ 2FA contact information updated
- ☐ Admin passwords they knew have been changed
- ☐ Company devices returned or wiped
- ☐ Accounts registered under their email have been transferred
- ☐ Billing on their credit card has been moved
- ☐ Knowledge transfer completed and documented
- ☐ One-week audit completed

## The Uncomfortable Conversation

If you discover a former employee still has access weeks or months after leaving:

**Don't panic, but do act quickly:**
- Revoke access immediately
- Change passwords immediately
- Audit recent activity in those accounts
- Reach out to them professionally to inform them access has been removed

**Learn from it:**
- How did this get missed?
- What process prevented this from being caught?
- How do you ensure it doesn't happen again?

This happens more often than businesses want to admit. The key is fixing it quickly and preventing it going forward.

## The Bottom Line

When someone leaves your company:
- Revoke their access systematically and quickly
- Transfer what they controlled to appropriate people
- Change passwords they knew
- Document the transition
- Audit to ensure nothing was missed
- Learn from the process to improve it next time

This applies to all departures - good terms, bad terms, employees, contractors, everyone. It's not personal. It's professional security practice.

And the time to plan for this is before someone gives notice, not after.

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
