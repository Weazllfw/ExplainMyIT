# What 'Managed IT Services' Actually Means (And What It Doesn't)

"We provide managed IT services" is something you hear constantly. But what does it actually mean?

Every IT provider uses this term, but they all mean something different. One company's "managed services" is another's "basic monitoring." And you're left wondering what you're actually paying for.

Here's what managed IT services really means — what's typically included, what costs extra, and how to decide if you need it.

## What Is "Managed IT Services" (Simple Definition)?

**Traditional IT**: You call when something breaks. They fix it. You pay per incident or hourly.

## Managed IT vs. Other IT Service Models

### Break-Fix Model
**How it works**: You call when something breaks. They fix it. You pay per incident.

**Pros**: No monthly fee. Only pay when you need help.

**Cons**: No proactive support. Issues surprise you. Can get expensive fast.

**Cost**: $100-200/hour, typically

---

### Managed Services Model
**How it works**: Flat monthly fee for defined services. Proactive monitoring and maintenance.

**Pros**: Predictable costs. Fewer emergencies. Proactive issue prevention.

**Cons**: Monthly fee even if nothing breaks. May pay for services you don't use.

**Cost**: $100-250/device/user per month

[See examples](/examples) of what managed IT actually monitors and maintains on a day-to-day basis.

---

### In-House IT
**How it works**: You employ IT staff directly.

**Pros**: Dedicated to your business. Deep knowledge of your systems. Immediate availability.

**Cons**: Expensive (salary + benefits + training). Limited expertise (one person can't know everything).

**Cost**: $50,000-100,000+ per year for one person

---

### Hybrid Model
**How it works**: Basic in-house person + MSP for specialized needs or overflow

**Pros**: Daily support in-house, expert help when needed

**Cons**: Coordination between internal and external

**Cost**: In-house salary + reduced MSP fees

---

## How MSPs Typically Price Their Services

### Per-Device Model
**How it works**: $X per computer/device managed

**Example**: $100/month per workstation, $250/month per server

**Pros**: Simple, scales with business

**Cons**: Can get expensive with lots of devices

---

### Per-User Model
**How it works**: $X per employee

**Example**: $150/month per user (covers their computer, email, phone, etc.)

**Pros**: Simple to understand

**Cons**: Doesn't account for server-heavy businesses

---

### Flat-Rate Model
**How it works**: One price for everything, regardless of devices/users

**Example**: $2,000/month for up to 25 users

**Pros**: Very predictable

**Cons**: Might overpay if you're small, underpay if you're large (and MSP might cut corners)

---

### Tiered Packages
**How it works**: Basic/Standard/Premium packages with different features

**Example**:
- Basic: $100/user (monitoring, remote support)
- Standard: $150/user (adds backups, security)
- Premium: $250/user (adds strategic planning, faster response)

**Pros**: Choose what you need

**Cons**: Can be confusing what's in each tier

### About Services

1. **What exactly is included in your monthly fee?**

---

## Red Flags When Evaluating MSPs

### "Unlimited Everything"
**Why it's a red flag**: Nothing is truly unlimited. Read the fine print.

**What to look for**: Reasonable use policies, exclusions

---

### Extremely Low Pricing
**Why it's a red flag**: You get what you pay for. If price is 50% below market, corners are being cut.

**What to ask**: What's included at that price? How do you keep costs so low?

---

### No Written SLA
**Why it's a red flag**: Without a service level agreement, you have no recourse for poor service.

**What to demand**: Written SLA with response times and uptime guarantees

---

### Long-Term Contracts with No Escape
**Why it's a red flag**: Good MSPs earn your business monthly. Bad MSPs trap you.

**What to negotiate**: Month-to-month or annual contract with reasonable termination clause

---

### They Don't Ask Questions
**Why it's a red flag**: How can they quote you accurately without understanding your needs?

**What to expect**: Discovery call, questions about your systems and goals, tailored proposal

---

## When Managed IT Makes Sense

### You Should Consider Managed IT If:
- You have 5+ employees
- You're spending >10 hours/month on IT issues
- You've had multiple unexpected IT emergencies
- Your current IT is reactive, not proactive
- You want predictable IT costs
- You don't have (and don't want) in-house IT staff

---

### Managed IT Might Not Make Sense If:
- You're a solo business with simple IT needs
- You have capable in-house IT staff
- You rarely have IT issues
- Your IT is already stable and well-maintained
- You prefer to pay only when you need help

---

## What Good Managed IT Actually Looks Like

### Proactive
- They catch issues before you notice
- Regular maintenance prevents problems
- You hear from them before things break

---

### Communicative
- Monthly reports on system health
- Quarterly business reviews
- They explain things in plain English
- Fast response to tickets

---

### Strategic
- They recommend improvements
- They plan for your growth
- They align IT with your business goals
- They're a partner, not just a vendor

---

### Transparent
- Clear invoicing
- No surprise charges
- Honest about limitations
- Admit when something is outside their expertise

---

## Bottom Line: Is Managed IT Worth It?

**Managed IT is worth it if**:
- Monthly cost < cost of frequent emergencies + your time
- You value predictability over pay-as-you-go
- You want proactive support, not reactive firefighting

**It's not worth it if**:
- You rarely have IT issues
- You prefer to pay only when you need help
- You have capable in-house IT already

**Average breakeven**: If you're spending 10+ hours/month on IT issues OR paying $200+/month in break-fix fees, managed probably makes sense.

**Don't choose based on price alone**: Cheapest MSP is rarely best MSP. Choose based on service quality, communication, and fit.

---

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.
