# Evaluating IT Proposals: Red Flags and Green Flags

You've asked several IT providers for proposals. Now you have 3-5 documents full of technical terms, varying prices, and promises that all sound good.

How do you actually evaluate them when you're not technical?

Here's what to look for (and what to run from) when reviewing IT proposals — in plain English.

---

## What Should Be in a Good IT Proposal?

### 1. **Clear Scope of Work**
**What it should say**: Exactly what they will do, in specific terms

**Good example**:
- "Monitor and maintain 10 workstations"
- "Provide email support via Google Workspace"
- "Backup website daily, retain for 30 days"
- "Respond to support requests within 4 business hours"

**Bad example**:
- "Manage IT infrastructure"
- "Provide ongoing support"
- "Handle technology needs"

**Why it matters**: Vague scope = disputes later about what's "included."

---

### 2. **Transparent Pricing**
**What it should include**:
- Base monthly or project cost
- What's included in that price
- What costs extra
- How billing works

**Good example**:
- "$500/month includes monitoring 10 devices, email support, monthly security updates"
- "On-site visits billed at $150/hour"
- "After-hours emergency support: $200/hour"

**Bad example**:
- "$500/month for IT services"
- "Competitive hourly rates"
- "We'll work with your budget"

**Why it matters**: Hidden costs add up. You need to know what you're actually paying for.

---

### 3. **Response Time Commitments**
**What it should say**: How quickly they'll respond to issues

**Good example**:
- "Critical issues: 1-hour response time"
- "Standard issues: 4-hour response time"
- "Non-urgent requests: 24-hour response time"

**Bad example**:
- "We respond quickly"
- "24/7 availability"
- No mention of response times at all

**Why it matters**: "24/7 availability" doesn't mean "24/7 response." Get specific commitments.

---

### 4. **Deliverables and Timeline**
**For projects**: What will be delivered and when

**Good example**:
- "Week 1: Site assessment and documentation"
- "Week 2-3: Server setup and testing"
- "Week 4: Go-live and training"

**Bad example**:
- "Project will be completed promptly"
- No timeline provided

**Why it matters**: "When will this be done?" shouldn't be a mystery.

---

### 5. **Terms and Termination**
**What it should include**:
- Contract length (month-to-month? 1 year? 3 years?)
- How to cancel
- Notice period required
- What happens to your data if you leave

**Good example**:
- "Month-to-month agreement"
- "30 days written notice to cancel"
- "All data returned in standard formats within 7 days"

**Bad example**:
- "3-year commitment required"
- "No cancellation during contract period"
- No mention of what happens when you leave

**Why it matters**: You need to be able to leave if the relationship doesn't work out.

---

## Red Flags: Run Away If You See These

### 1. **Vague or Missing Scope**
**What it looks like**:
- "We'll handle all your IT needs"
- "Full-service IT support"
- No specifics about what's included

**Why it's bad**: You'll have constant debates about whether something is "included" or "extra."

**What to do**: Ask for specific scope. If they won't provide it, move on.

---

### 2. **Pricing That Doesn't Make Sense**
**What it looks like**:
- Significantly cheaper than everyone else (too good to be true usually is)
- Significantly more expensive with no clear justification
- Refuses to provide written quote
- "We'll figure out pricing as we go"

**Why it's bad**: Either they're underpricing (and will cut corners) or overpricing (and hoping you don't notice).

**What to do**: Get everything in writing. Ask "why is this price different from competitors?"

---

### 3. **Long-Term Contracts with No Escape**
**What it looks like**:
- "3-year commitment required"
- "Early termination fee: $10,000"
- "No cancellation policy"

**Why it's bad**: You're locked in even if service is terrible.

**What to do**: Negotiate shorter terms or reasonable termination clauses. Month-to-month or annual contracts with 30-60 day notice are standard.

---

### 4. **"Trust Us" Mentality**
**What it looks like**:
- "We're the experts, just trust us"
- Unwilling to explain technical details in plain English
- Dismissive of your questions
- No documentation or reporting provided

**Why it's bad**: Good providers educate clients. "Trust us" providers often mean "don't ask questions."

**What to do**: Ask questions. If they can't or won't explain things clearly, they're not the right fit.

---

### 5. **No References or Portfolio**
**What it looks like**:
- Can't provide client references
- Won't show examples of past work
- "All our clients are confidential"

**Why it's bad**: Legitimate providers have happy clients who will vouch for them.

**What to do**: Ask for 2-3 references. Call them. Ask about responsiveness, quality, and issues.

---

### 6. **Pressure Tactics**
**What it looks like**:
- "This price is only good if you sign today"
- "We can only take on 2 more clients"
- High-pressure sales tactics
- Dismissing other vendors ("everyone else is incompetent")

**Why it's bad**: Good providers don't need to pressure you. Their work speaks for itself.

**What to do**: Take your time. Any provider using pressure tactics is showing you how they'll treat you as a client.

---

### 7. **Missing SLA (Service Level Agreement)**
**What it looks like**:
- No commitment to response times
- No uptime guarantees
- No consequences if they don't deliver

**Why it's bad**: Without an SLA, you have no recourse when service is poor.

**What to do**: Ask for specific SLA terms. If they won't commit, they're telling you something.

---

### 8. **They Don't Ask Questions**
**What it looks like**:
- Generic proposal that could apply to any business
- No discovery call or site visit
- They didn't ask about your specific needs

**Why it's bad**: How can they propose a solution if they don't understand your problems?

**What to do**: Good proposals come after conversations. If they didn't ask questions, the proposal is probably templated.

---

## Green Flags: What Good Proposals Include

### 1. **Specific, Detailed Scope**
**What it looks like**:
- Line-by-line breakdown of services
- Clear deliverables
- Specific systems or devices covered

**Why it's good**: No surprises. You know exactly what you're getting. Request examples similar to [these IT reports](/examples) if you want to see what documented scope looks like.

---

### 2. **Transparent, Itemized Pricing**
**What it looks like**:
- Base cost broken down by service
- Clear explanation of what's included vs. extra
- No hidden fees
- Honest about ongoing costs

**Why it's good**: You can budget accurately and compare proposals fairly.

---

### 3. **Clear SLA with Response Times**
**What it looks like**:
- Guaranteed response times by priority level
- Uptime guarantees
- Remedies if they don't meet SLA

**Why it's good**: You have recourse if service quality drops.

---

### 4. **Documentation and Reporting**
**What it looks like**:
- "Monthly reports on system health"
- "Documented configurations and passwords"
- "Quarterly review meetings"

**Why it's good**: You stay informed. Knowledge doesn't live only in the provider's head.

---

### 5. **Reasonable Contract Terms**
**What it looks like**:
- Month-to-month or annual contracts
- Clear cancellation terms (30-60 days notice)
- Data portability guaranteed

**Why it's good**: You're not trapped. You can leave if the relationship doesn't work.

---

### 6. **They Ask About Your Business**
**What it looks like**:
- Discovery calls before proposal
- Questions about your goals, not just technical specs
- Proposal tailored to your specific needs

**Why it's good**: They're solving your problems, not selling a one-size-fits-all package.

---

### 7. **References and Social Proof**
**What it looks like**:
- Client testimonials
- Case studies
- Willingness to provide references
- Online reviews

**Why it's good**: Track record matters. Other clients' experiences predict yours.

---

### 8. **They Explain Things Clearly**
**What it looks like**:
- No unnecessary jargon
- Willing to answer questions
- Educational, not condescending
- You understand what they're proposing

**Why it's good**: Communication matters. If they can't explain things clearly now, they won't later.

---

## How to Compare Multiple Proposals

### Step 1: Create a Comparison Spreadsheet

**Columns**:
- Provider name
- Monthly cost
- One-time costs
- Scope (what's included)
- Response time commitments
- Contract length
- Cancellation terms

**Goal**: Apples-to-apples comparison

---

### Step 2: Normalize Pricing

**Watch out for**:
- One provider's "base" price excludes things others include
- Some quote monthly, others annually
- One-time setup fees vs. ongoing costs

**Adjust**: Calculate total cost over 1 year to compare fairly

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Scope

**Questions**:
- Do all proposals include the same services?
- Are some providers offering more or less than you need?
- Which proposal best matches your actual needs?

**Beware**: The cheapest proposal might exclude critical services

---

### Step 4: Check Qualifications

**Research each provider**:
- How long in business?
- Certifications or specializations?
- Client reviews?
- Financial stability?

**Red flag**: Brand new provider with no track record (risky)

---

### Step 5: Call References

**Questions to ask references**:
- How responsive are they?
- Do they communicate clearly?
- Have they solved problems effectively?
- Any surprises with billing?
- Would you hire them again?

**Note**: Don't skip this. References reveal things proposals don't.

---

## Questions to Ask Before Signing

### About Service

1. **What's your average response time?** (Not just the SLA — actual average)
2. **Who will be my main contact?** (Single person? Team? Ticket system?)
3. **How do you handle after-hours emergencies?**
4. **What happens if my main contact leaves your company?**

---

### About Costs

5. **What typically costs extra?** (Be specific — what's not included?)
6. **How do you bill for additional work?** (Hourly? Project-based?)
7. **When do prices typically increase?** (Annual? Based on usage?)
8. **Are there any fees not mentioned in the proposal?**

---

### About the Relationship

9. **How often will we meet or get updates?**
10. **What documentation will you provide?**
11. **How do we handle disagreements about scope?**
12. **What's your process for termination?** (If we decide to leave)

---

## The Price Question: Why Is One So Much Cheaper?

**If one proposal is significantly cheaper**, there's usually a reason:

### Possible Reasons (Good)
- Newer company building client base
- Leaner operation with lower overhead
- You don't need all the features others are selling

### Possible Reasons (Bad)
- They're underestimating effort (will cut corners or bill extra)
- They're desperate for business (financial instability)
- Scope is narrower than you realize
- They plan to make money on "extras"

**What to do**: Ask directly. "Your price is 30% lower than others. Why?" Listen carefully to the answer.

---

## The Price Question: Why Is One So Much More Expensive?

**If one proposal is significantly more expensive**, understand why:

### Possible Reasons (Good)
- Higher quality service
- More comprehensive scope
- Better SLA and response times
- Specialized expertise you need

### Possible Reasons (Bad)
- They're pricing for enterprise when you need small business
- They're overpricing assuming you won't notice
- Lots of unnecessary services bundled in

**What to do**: Ask what justifies the price. If they can explain the value clearly, it might be worth it. If not, it's probably overpriced.

---

## Red Flags in Contracts (Not Just Proposals)

Before signing, watch for:

### 1. **Automatic Renewal Without Notice**
**Bad**: "Contract auto-renews for 1 year unless canceled 90 days before expiration"

**Why**: Easy to miss deadline, stuck for another year

---

### 2. **Broad Liability Limitations**
**Bad**: "Provider is not liable for any damages, losses, or downtime"

**Why**: If they screw up majorly, you have no recourse

**Reasonable**: "Liability limited to fees paid in past 3 months"

---

### 3. **Vague Change Order Process**
**Bad**: "Additional work billed as needed"

**Why**: Scope creep, surprise bills

**Good**: "Change orders require written approval with price quote"

---

### 4. **IP Ownership Ambiguity**
**Bad**: "Any custom work remains property of provider"

**Why**: If you leave, you can't take custom solutions with you

**Good**: "Client owns all custom configurations and data"

---

## Bottom Line: How to Choose

**Don't choose based on**:
- Price alone (cheapest is rarely best)
- Who you talked to first
- Who has the fanciest proposal document

**Do choose based on**:
- Clear, transparent proposal
- Good references
- Communication style (you'll deal with them a lot)
- Fair contract terms
- Proven track record

**Trust your gut**: If something feels off, it probably is. If they're hard to work with during sales, they'll be worse as a vendor.

---

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
