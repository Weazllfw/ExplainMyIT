# Your Domain Just Expired: Now What?

Your website is down. Your email isn't working. You check your domain registrar and see: **"Domain Expired."**

Panic sets in. How did this happen? Can you get it back? How much will it cost?

Here's exactly what happens when a domain expires, how to recover it, and how to prevent this from ever happening again.

---

## What Actually Happens When a Domain Expires?

### Day 1 (Expiration Date)
**What happens**: Your domain enters a "grace period"

**What still works**:
- Website: Usually yes (for now)
- Email: Usually yes (for now)
- DNS: Still resolves

**What you can do**: Renew normally at regular price

**Duration**: 0-45 days (varies by registrar and TLD)

**Note**: Some registrars disable the domain immediately. Others give you a grace period. It depends.

---

### Day 1-30 (Grace Period)
**What happens**: Domain is expired but you can still renew it easily

**What might stop working**:
- Some registrars disable DNS immediately
- Email might stop working
- Website might go down
- Or everything might keep working (depends on registrar)

**What you can do**: Log into your registrar and renew normally (maybe a small late fee)

**Cost**: Regular renewal price + maybe $10-50 late fee

---

### Day 30-70 (Redemption Period)
**What happens**: Domain is locked and enters "redemption"

**What stops working**:
- Website: Down
- Email: Not working
- DNS: Disabled

**What you can do**: Request redemption (recovery) through your registrar

**Cost**: $100-$200+ redemption fee (on top of renewal price)

**Why so expensive?**: Registries charge registrars high fees to recover expired domains. They pass that cost to you.

---

### Day 70-75 (Pending Delete)
**What happens**: Domain is scheduled for deletion

**What you can do**: Almost nothing. Some registrars won't allow redemption at this point.

**Cost**: Redemption fee (if allowed) or wait for public release

---

### Day 75+ (Deleted/Released)
**What happens**: Domain is released back to the public. Anyone can register it.

**What you can do**:
- Try to register it immediately when it's released
- Hope no one else grabs it
- Pay a domain auction/backorder service ($100-$1,000+)

**Reality**: If your domain has any value, someone will grab it immediately. You might lose it forever.

---

## How to Recover an Expired Domain

### If It's in Grace Period (0-30 days)

**Step 1**: Log into your domain registrar
- Find your registrar (check old emails or use WHOIS lookup)
- Log in (or reset password if you forgot)

**Step 2**: Find the expired domain
- Look for "Expired Domains" or "Manage Domains"
- Your domain should show as expired or expiring soon

**Step 3**: Renew it
- Click "Renew" or "Reactivate"
- Pay the renewal fee (+ possible late fee)
- Renewal should process immediately

**Step 4**: Verify it's working
- Check website loads (DNS might take 1-24 hours to propagate)
- Test email
- Verify expiration date is extended

**Cost**: $10-50/year renewal + $0-50 late fee  
**Time**: Minutes to hours

---

### If It's in Redemption Period (30-70 days)

**Step 1**: Contact your registrar immediately
- Call them (email is too slow)
- Say: "I need to recover a domain in redemption"

**Step 2**: Request domain redemption
- They'll verify you're the owner
- They'll quote redemption fee ($100-200+)
- Agree to the fee

**Step 3**: Pay the redemption fee
- Plus the renewal fee
- Total might be $120-250 or more

**Step 4**: Wait for recovery (1-7 days)
- Registrar submits redemption request to registry
- Takes time to process
- You'll get confirmation when it's restored

**Step 5**: Renew for multiple years
- Once recovered, renew for 2-5 years
- Enable auto-renew
- Never let this happen again

**Cost**: $120-300+ total  
**Time**: 1-7 days

---

### If It's Been Deleted (75+ days)

**Option 1: Try to Register It Immediately**
- Watch for the exact moment it's released (hard to predict)
- Try to register it the second it's available
- Use a domain monitoring service

**Success rate**: Low (bots and domain investors watch too)

---

**Option 2: Use a Backorder Service**
- Services like SnapNames, Drop Catch, or NameJet
- They attempt to register the domain when it drops
- Cost: $60-100 backorder fee + auction if others want it
- Not guaranteed (if others backorder, goes to auction)

**Success rate**: Medium (better than DIY, not guaranteed)

---

**Option 3: Contact the New Owner**
- If someone else registered it, use WHOIS to find them
- Offer to buy it back
- Expect to pay significantly more than renewal would have cost

**Cost**: $500-$10,000+ (depending on domain value and new owner)

---

**Option 4: Give Up and Pick a New Domain**
- Sometimes this is the most practical option
- Pick a new domain name
- Update all your materials
- Move on

**Cost**: Minimal, but requires rebranding

Many owners discover expiration issues during [insurance renewals](/use-cases#insurance-renewal) or [business sales](/use-cases#business-acquisition). [Monthly IT monitoring](/why-monthly) catches expiration issues 60-90 days before they become critical, making recovery far cheaper and easier.

## Why Domains Expire (And How to Prevent It)

### Reason #1: Auto-Renew Was Disabled
**How it happens**:
- You disabled it by accident
- Previous owner/IT person disabled it
- Registrar disabled it during a system change

**Prevention**: Log into registrar now. Verify auto-renew is ON.

---

### Reason #2: Payment Method Failed
**How it happens**:
- Credit card expired
- Credit card was canceled
- Insufficient funds
- Billing address changed

**Prevention**:
- Update payment method now
- Use a credit card that won't expire soon
- Set calendar reminder to check annually

---

### Reason #3: Email Notifications Went to Wrong Address
**How it happens**:
- Domain registered under old employee's email
- Email address no longer monitored
- Notifications went to spam

**Prevention**:
- Update registrar contact email to current owner/admin
- Add multiple contact emails if possible
- Whitelist registrar emails to avoid spam

---

### Reason #4: No One Was Paying Attention
**How it happens**:
- Founder registered it years ago, forgot about it
- IT person who managed it left
- Assumed someone else was handling it

**Prevention**:
- Document who is responsible for domains
- Calendar reminder 60 days before expiration
- Quarterly review of domain status

---

### Reason #5: Registrar Account Lost
**How it happens**:
- Forgot which registrar has the domain
- Lost login credentials
- Email address associated with account no longer exists

**Prevention**:
- Document where your domain is registered
- Use password manager for credentials
- Use business email (not personal) as registrar contact

---

## How to Prevent Domain Expiration

### 1. Enable Auto-Renew NOW
- Log into your registrar
- Find domain settings
- Turn on auto-renew
- Verify it's actually enabled (some registrars are buggy)

**This prevents 90% of expirations.**

---

### 2. Update Payment Method
- Make sure credit card is current
- Add backup payment method if possible
- Use a card that won't expire soon

---

### 3. Renew for Multiple Years
- Renew for 3-5 years instead of 1
- Reduces frequency of potential expiration
- Often cheaper per year

**Example**: 1-year: $15/year × 3 = $45. 3-year: $40 total.

---

### 4. Set Calendar Reminders
- 60 days before expiration: Check domain status
- 30 days before: Verify auto-renew is working
- 7 days before: Final check

**Even with auto-renew**, check manually. Auto-renew sometimes fails.

---

### 5. Use a Reputable Registrar
**Good registrars**:
- Send multiple expiration reminders
- Grace periods before disabling
- Easy renewal process
- Good customer support

**Bad registrars**:
- Disable domain immediately on expiration
- Charge excessive redemption fees
- Poor customer support

**Recommendation**: Namecheap, Google Domains (now Squarespace), or Cloudflare for business domains.

---

### 6. Document Everything
Create a document with:
- Domain name(s)
- Registrar
- Login credentials (in password manager)
- Expiration date
- Auto-renew status
- Billing contact

**Update annually** or whenever something changes.

---

### 7. Consider Domain Lock
**Domain lock** prevents unauthorized transfers (including accidental)

**How to enable**:
- Log into registrar
- Find "Domain Lock" or "Transfer Lock"
- Enable it

**Note**: This doesn't prevent expiration, but it prevents someone from stealing your domain.

---

## What to Do RIGHT NOW (Prevention Checklist)

☐ Find where your domain is registered  
☐ Log in (or reset password)  
☐ Check expiration date  
☐ Enable auto-renew  
☐ Update payment method  
☐ Renew for 2-5 years  
☐ Update contact email to current admin  
☐ Set calendar reminders (60/30/7 days before expiration)  
☐ Document this info for future reference  

**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Payoff**: Never deal with expired domain emergency

---

## Cost Comparison: Prevention vs. Recovery

### Scenario 1: Normal Renewal (Planned)
- Cost: $12-20/year
- Time: 5 minutes
- Downtime: None

---

### Scenario 2: Late Renewal (Grace Period)
- Cost: $12-50 (renewal + late fee)
- Time: 15 minutes
- Downtime: Maybe a few hours

---

### Scenario 3: Redemption Recovery
- Cost: $120-300
- Time: 1-7 days
- Downtime: 1-7 days (website and email down)

---

### Scenario 4: Lost Domain (Must Buy Back)
- Cost: $500-$10,000+
- Time: Weeks of negotiation
- Downtime: Permanent (or until resolved)
- Additional: Rebranding costs, lost business

---

**The lesson**: $12/year prevention is a lot cheaper than $300 recovery or $10,000 buyback.

---

## Red Flags: You Might Be at Risk

### 1. "I Don't Know When My Domain Expires"
**Fix**: Look it up now. WHOIS lookup or check registrar account.

---

### 2. "I'm Not Sure Who Registered Our Domain"
**Fix**: WHOIS lookup shows registrant info (if not private). Contact them and transfer to company control.

---

### 3. "Auto-Renew Is Probably On"
**Fix**: "Probably" isn't good enough. Log in and verify.

---

### 4. "We Haven't Updated the Credit Card in Years"
**Fix**: Update payment method now before it fails.

---

### 5. "I Don't Know the Registrar Login"
**Fix**: Reset password. If email address is old/inaccessible, contact registrar support with proof of ownership.

---

## Questions Business Owners Ask

### "Can I Transfer My Domain to Prevent Expiration?"
**Answer**: Yes, transferring to a new registrar adds 1 year to expiration automatically. But if it's already expired, you must recover it first.

---

### "What If I Can't Afford Redemption Fees?"
**Answer**: Contact your registrar. Sometimes they'll work with you. Otherwise, wait for deletion and try to reregister (risky).

---

### "Will My Website Come Back Immediately After Renewal?"
**Answer**: Usually within 1-24 hours. DNS propagation takes time. Be patient.

---

### "What If Someone Already Registered My Expired Domain?"
**Answer**: You'll need to negotiate a buyback (expensive) or choose a new domain. This is why prevention matters.

---

### "Should I Register Multiple Versions of My Domain?"
**Answer**: If your brand is valuable, yes. Register .com, .net, common misspellings. Prevents someone else from using similar domains.

---

## Bottom Line

**Domain expiration is 100% preventable.**

**Prevention checklist**:
1. Enable auto-renew

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.
