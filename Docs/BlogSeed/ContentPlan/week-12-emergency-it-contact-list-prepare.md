# Emergency IT Contact List: What to Prepare Now (Before You Need It)

It's 2 AM. Your website is down. Or your email isn't working. Or your domain expired. Or you're locked out of critical systems.

Who do you call?

Most business owners don't know until they're in crisis mode — frantically Googling, digging through old emails, trying phone numbers that don't work anymore.

Here's what to document *now* so you're not scrambling during an IT emergency.

---

## Why "I'll Figure It Out When It Happens" Doesn't Work

**In an IT emergency**:
- You're stressed and not thinking clearly
- Every minute of downtime costs money
- Old contact info might be outdated
- You waste time hunting for information
- Some issues have time-sensitive fixes

**With a prepared contact list**:
- You know exactly who to call
- You have all necessary account info
- You can act immediately
- You reduce downtime
- You stay calm(er)

**Time to create list**: 1-2 hours  
**Time saved during emergency**: Hours to days

---

## What to Include in Your IT Emergency Contact List

**Information to document**:

**Example**:

## Common Emergency Scenarios and Who to Call

### Website Is Down
**Call first**: Hosting provider  
**Why**: They control the server  
**Backup**: Web developer (if hosting says it's not their issue)

---

### Email Not Working
**Call first**: Email provider  
**Why**: They control email service  
**Check**: MX records haven't changed unexpectedly

---

### Domain Expired
**Call first**: Domain registrar  
**Why**: Only they can renew/restore  
**Urgent**: Redemption period is time-sensitive

---

### Site Hacked
**Call first**: Hosting provider (to take site offline)  
**Call second**: Security service or web developer (to clean)  
**Call third**: IT support (to harden security)

---

### SSL Certificate Error
**Call first**: Hosting provider (if they manage SSL)  
**Why**: Usually quick fix on their end  
**Backup**: Web developer if custom SSL

---

### Locked Out of Admin
**Call first**: Web developer (to reset)  
**Why**: They have backup access  
**Backup**: Hosting provider (database access for reset)

---

## How to Store This Information Securely

### Use a Password Manager
**Recommended**: 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden

**Why**:
- Encrypted and secure
- Accessible from anywhere
- Can be shared with trusted team members
- Easy to update

**How to organize**:
- Create folder: "IT Emergency Contacts"
- Store each contact as a "Secure Note"
- Include all relevant info
- Add actual credentials as separate login entries

---

### Backup: Physical Document
**Why**: If you can't access password manager (unlikely but possible)

**What to document**:
- Contact names and phone numbers
- URLs and account identifiers
- Emergency procedures

**What NOT to document on paper**: Actual passwords (security risk)

**Where to store**: Locked safe, file cabinet, known location

---

### Share with Key People
**Who should have access**:
- Business owner
- Backup person (manager, partner)
- Trusted admin

**How to share**:
- Through password manager sharing
- Or physical copy in secure location
- Not via email or unencrypted files

## Testing Your Emergency Plan

**Schedule a quarterly drill**:

**Test 1: Website Recovery**
- Can you access hosting control panel?
- Can you find backup files?
- Do you know how to restore?

**Test 2: Contact Verification**
- Call each support number
- Verify they're still correct
- Confirm account numbers work

**Test 3: Access Verification**
- Log into each critical system
- Confirm passwords are current
- Verify two-factor auth works

**Test 4: Team Communication**
- Does your backup person have access?
- Can they find the emergency list?
- Do they know the procedures?

## Red Flags: You're Not Prepared

### "I Think the Number Is..."
**Fix**: Document exact numbers now, don't rely on memory

---

### "It's Probably in an Old Email Somewhere..."
**Fix**: Search now, document, don't wait for emergency

---

### "Only One Person Knows How to Fix This"
**Fix**: Document their process, create backup contact

---

### "We'll Google It If Something Goes Wrong"
**Fix**: Google during a crisis wastes time. Document now.

---

### "I Haven't Tested Backups in Years"
**Fix**: Test restoration this week

---

## What to Do in an Actual Emergency

### Step 1: Don't Panic
- Stressed decisions are bad decisions
- Take 2 minutes to breathe and think

---

### Step 2: Assess the Situation
- What exactly isn't working?
- When did it start?
- Did anything change recently?
- Is it affecting customers?

---

### Step 3: Consult Your Contact List
- Who handles this specific issue?
- What information will they need?
- What's the escalation path?

---

### Step 4: Make the Call
- Be clear about the issue
- Provide account/system details
- Ask for estimated resolution time
- Get ticket/case number

---

### Step 5: Document Everything
- What happened
- Who you called
- What they did
- How it was resolved
- When it was resolved

**Why**: If it happens again, you'll know the fix

---

## Update Schedule

**Monthly**:
- Review for outdated phone numbers or contacts
- Verify critical systems still accessible

**Quarterly**:
- Test emergency procedures
- Practice backup restoration
- Verify support contacts still work

**Annually**:
- Full audit of all information
- Update any changed services or providers
- Review emergency procedures with team

---

## Special Situations

### Remote/After-Hours
**Extra info needed**:
- VPN access (if required for some systems)
- Phone numbers that work outside business hours
- Backup contacts if primary is unavailable

---

### Multiple Team Members
**Document who's responsible for what**:
- Primary contact for each system
- Backup contact if primary unavailable
- Who has authority to authorize emergency spending

---

### Seasonal Businesses
**Plan for off-season**:
- Who monitors systems when business is closed?
- How to reach key people during off-season?
- Automated monitoring alerts

---

## Bottom Line

**Create your emergency contact list NOW, before you need it.**

**Minimum list**:
1. Domain registrar
2. Hosting provider
3. Email provider
4. Web developer/IT support
5. Backup system details

**Time to create**: 1-2 hours  
**Time saved during emergency**: Hours to days  
**Peace of mind**: Priceless

**Don't wait for a crisis.** 30 minutes now prevents hours of panic later.

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
