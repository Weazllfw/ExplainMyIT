# Spring IT Cleanup: What Business Owners Should Review Now

Tax season just ended. Q1 is done. You're planning for Q2.

This is the perfect time to look at your IT setup and ask: "What do I wish I had known three months ago?"

Spring IT cleanup isn't about deep technical maintenance. It's about reviewing what worked, what didn't, and what needs attention before Q2 gets busy.

Here's what business owners should check now.

---

## Why Spring?

**Q1 just ended**. You have fresh perspective on what IT issues came up:
- Did your website go down?
- Did email cause problems?
- Did you struggle to answer insurance or financial questions?
- Did anything expire unexpectedly?

**Q2 is starting**. You have time to fix issues before summer (when vacations and staffing create more risk).

**Tax season just happened**. You're in "review mode" anyway. Extend that mindset to IT.

## The Spring IT Review Checklist

### 1. **Review What Broke in Q1**

**Ask yourself**:
- Did we have any IT incidents? (Downtime, security issues, lost data)
- What caused them?
- Did we fix the root cause, or just the symptom?
- Could this happen again?

**Document it**: Write down what went wrong and what you did about it. Future you will thank you.

**Example**: Website went down in February because hosting ran out of disk space. Solution applied: Upgraded hosting plan. Root cause: No monitoring. Fix needed: Set up disk space alerts.

---

### 2. **Check What Expires in Q2 (April-June)**

**Domain registrations**:
- When does your domain expire?
- Is auto-renew enabled?
- Is payment method current?

**SSL certificates**:
- When does your SSL expire?
- Is it set to auto-renew?
- Do you get alerts before expiration?

**Service subscriptions**:
- What services renew in Q2? (Hosting, email, software)
- Are you still using them?
- Is pricing still reasonable?

**Why this matters**: Things that expire in Q2 should be on your radar now, not the day they expire.

---

### 3. **Review Q1 IT Spending**

**Pull your Q1 expenses**:
- How much did you spend on hosting, domains, software, IT support?
- Were there surprise expenses?
- Are you paying for services you no longer use?

**Questions to ask**:
- What's our monthly IT baseline? (Regular costs)
- What were one-time costs? (Fixes, upgrades, emergencies)
- Is our spending reasonable for our business size?
- Are there recurring charges we can cancel?

**Common findings**: Many businesses discover subscriptions they forgot about or duplicate services.

---

### 4. **Security Check Before Summer**

**Why now?**: Summer brings vacations, reduced staffing, and more opportunity for issues to go unnoticed.

**Quick security review**:
- Are software updates current? (Website, plugins, operating systems)
- Are passwords strong and unique? (No password123 or reused passwords)
- Is two-factor authentication enabled on critical accounts?
- Are backups running and tested?
- Is email security configured? (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)

**Goal**: Fix security gaps before summer when you're less available to deal with issues.

---

### 5. **Clean Up Unused Accounts and Access**

**Q1 changes**:
- Did anyone leave the company?
- Did contractors or vendors lose access?
- Are there old employee accounts still active?

**Spring cleanup**:
- Disable accounts for anyone who left
- Review who has admin access (should be minimal)
- Check vendor access (still necessary?)
- Remove unused email accounts or aliases

**Why this matters**: Every active account is a potential security risk. Clean up now while you're thinking about it.

---

### 6. **Review Website and Email Performance**

**Website**:
- How fast does it load? (Test with PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix)
- Were there downtime incidents?
- Is content current? (Remove outdated info)
- Are forms and contact methods working?

**Email**:
- Are emails delivering reliably?
- Are you seeing more spam or deliverability issues?
- Is email storage approaching limits?
- Do you need to archive old emails?

**Quick test**: Send yourself a test email. Does it arrive? Does it look right?

---

### 7. **Data Cleanup**

**Files and storage**:
- What can be archived or deleted? (Old projects, outdated files)
- Are backups taking too long because of unnecessary data?
- Is cloud storage approaching limits?

**Email**:
- Archive emails older than 2 years (keep them, just move them)
- Delete spam and trash
- Organize important emails into folders

**Why spring?**: Like cleaning out a closet — do it seasonally before it becomes overwhelming.

---

### 8. **Documentation Check**

**What should be documented but isn't?**:
- Where is your domain registered?
- Who has access to critical accounts?
- What's your backup process?
- Who do you call when something breaks?

**If Q1 had IT incidents**: Did you have the information you needed to fix them quickly?

**Spring task**: Spend 1 hour documenting your IT setup. Future you will thank you. Create a [dated record of your IT](/why-monthly) setup while you're reviewing everything.

---

### 9. **Insurance and Compliance Review**

**If your insurance renews in Q2-Q3**:
- What IT questions will they ask?
- Can you answer them confidently now?
- Do you have evidence (backups, security configurations, dated records)?

Spring is perfect timing to prepare for [insurance renewals](/use-cases#insurance-renewal) that typically happen in Q2-Q3. Get your documentation ready now, not when the application is due.

**Common insurance questions**:
- Do you have backups?
- Is email security configured?
- Is your SSL certificate current?
- Are software and systems updated?

**Spring preparation**: Get answers now, before renewal questionnaires arrive.

---

### 10. **Plan for Summer Vacations**

**Before someone (including you) goes on vacation**:
- Document critical processes
- Ensure someone else can access important accounts if needed
- Test backup systems (because problems happen when you're away)
- Set up out-of-office responses
- Brief someone on emergency procedures

**Why now?**: Summer vacations are 2-3 months away. Planning now prevents scrambling later.

## Tax Season Lessons for IT

**If tax season taught you anything about your IT, act on it now.**

### "I Couldn't Find That Document"
**Fix**: Organize file storage. Use consistent naming. Archive old files.

---

### "I Didn't Know We Paid for That Service"
**Fix**: Audit subscriptions. Cancel unused services. Consolidate where possible.

---

### "My Accountant Asked Questions I Couldn't Answer"
**Fix**: Document your IT setup. Know what you have and what you're paying for.

---

### "I Realized We're Not Backing Up Financial Data"
**Fix**: Set up backups for critical business files. Test restoration.

---

## Spring Maintenance Tasks (Technical)

If you have IT support, here's what they should be checking:

### Server and Hosting
- Apply security updates
- Review disk space usage
- Check backup logs
- Review performance metrics

### Network
- Update router firmware
- Review firewall rules
- Check Wi-Fi security settings
- Test network backup power (UPS)

### Software
- Update WordPress, plugins, themes
- Update desktop software
- Review license renewals
- Remove unused software

**Note**: If you don't have IT support, ask your hosting provider if they handle updates, or use managed services that include maintenance.

---

## Budget Review for Q2-Q4

**Spring is budget planning season.** Review your IT spending and plan ahead:

### Expected Costs (Q2-Q4)
- Domain renewals
- Hosting renewals
- Software license renewals
- Any planned upgrades

### Unexpected Costs (Budget Buffer)
- Emergency fixes
- Security incidents
- Unplanned upgrades

**Recommendation**: Budget 10-20% buffer for unplanned IT costs. It's better to have it and not need it.

---

## Red Flags to Address Now

### "I Don't Know When Things Expire"
**Fix**: Create a simple spreadsheet with expiration dates. Set calendar reminders 30 days before.

---

### "No One Knows the Admin Password"
**Fix**: Use a password manager. Document who has access. Test that you can actually log in.

---

### "We Haven't Updated Anything in Years"
**Fix**: Schedule updates quarterly. Or use managed services that handle it automatically.

---

### "I'm Not Sure If Backups Are Working"
**Fix**: Test restoration this week. Don't wait until you need it.

---

### "Our Website Is Embarrassingly Slow"
**Fix**: Test load speed. If it's over 5 seconds, investigate (hosting, bloated site, images too large).

---

## The One-Hour Spring IT Cleanup

**If you only have one hour, focus on this**:

1. **Check domain and SSL expiration** (5 minutes)
   - When do they expire? Is auto-renew on?

2. **Verify backups exist and are recent** (10 minutes)
   - Can you see backup files? When was the last one?

3. **Test your website** (5 minutes)
   - Does it load? How fast? Any errors?

4. **Review user accounts** (15 minutes)
   - Who has access to what? Anyone who shouldn't?

5. **Document your IT setup** (25 minutes)
   - Where is hosting? Who's the domain registrar? Where are backups stored?

**Done.** You now know more about your IT setup than 80% of small business owners.

## Questions to Ask Your IT Provider This Spring

If you use an IT provider or contractor, spring is a good time to check in:

1. **What issues did you notice in Q1?**
2. **Are there any upcoming renewals or expirations we should know about?**
3. **Is there anything we should upgrade or replace?**
4. **Are our backups working? When did you last test them?**
5. **What security improvements should we make?**
6. **Is there anything I should be documenting that I'm not?**

Good IT providers appreciate proactive clients. Use this conversation to understand your setup better.

---

## Summer Preparation Checklist

**Before summer starts (and people take vacations)**:

☐ Critical processes documented  
☐ Backup person identified for IT issues  
☐ Out-of-office responses ready  
☐ Emergency contact list updated  
☐ Systems tested and stable  
☐ No planned changes during peak vacation months  

**Why?**: Problems happen when you're least prepared. Being ready now means less stress later.

---

## Bottom Line: What Spring Cleanup Actually Means

**It's not about deep technical work.** It's about:
- Reviewing what happened in Q1
- Fixing what broke
- Preparing for Q2
- Documenting what you should have documented already
- Planning for summer (when issues are harder to fix)

**Time investment**: 1-3 hours

**Payoff**: Fewer surprises, better preparedness, less stress when issues arise

**Best time to do this**: Right now, while Q1 is fresh in your mind and Q2 hasn't gotten busy yet.

---

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
