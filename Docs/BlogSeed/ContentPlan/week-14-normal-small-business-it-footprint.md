# What a Normal Small Business IT Footprint Looks Like

"Is my IT setup normal or am I way behind?"

This is one of the most common questions business owners ask — and one of the hardest to answer without context.

You see competitors with fancy tech. You read articles about "must-have" systems. You worry you're falling behind.

Here's what normal actually looks like for small businesses — based on hundreds of real IT setups we've seen.

---

## Why "Normal" Matters

**You're not trying to compete with Fortune 500 companies.**

Most small businesses have similar IT setups. Some are more organized than others, but the baseline is surprisingly consistent.

**Knowing what's normal helps you**:
- Stop worrying you're way behind
- Identify real gaps (vs. imagined ones)
- Budget realistically
- Avoid overspending on unnecessary tech

## The Typical 5-10 Person Business

### Domain and Website
**What's normal**:
- One primary domain (.com preferred)
- Website on shared hosting ($5-20/month)
- WordPress or similar CMS
- SSL certificate (usually free via Let's Encrypt)
- Basic security plugin
- Hosting with decent support (GoDaddy, Bluehost, Hostgator)

**What's also normal**:
- Website hasn't been updated in 1-2 years
- Theme/plugins slightly outdated (not ideal, but common)
- No formal backup system (just relying on hosting)

**Red flags** (not normal):
- No SSL certificate
- Website down frequently
- Hosting costs $100+/month for simple site

---

### Email
**What's normal**:
- Google Workspace ($6-12/user/month)
- OR Microsoft 365 ($5-12/user/month)
- OR email through hosting provider (free-$5/month)

**What's normal (email security)**:
- SPF configured (60% of small businesses)
- DKIM maybe configured (40%)
- DMARC missing (80% don't have it)

**Red flags**:
- Using free Gmail without business domain
- No email security configured at all
- Frequent spam/deliverability issues

---

### File Storage and Collaboration
**What's normal**:
- Google Drive (if using Google Workspace)
- OneDrive (if using Microsoft 365)
- Dropbox ($10-20/month for business)
- OR local network drive (older businesses)

**What's also normal**:
- Files somewhat disorganized
- No formal naming conventions
- Some duplicate files across different locations

**Red flags**:
- Critical business files only on one person's computer
- No cloud backup of important files

---

### Computers/Devices
**What's normal**:
- Mix of Windows PCs ($500-1,200 each)
- Some Macs (especially for creative businesses)
- Computers 2-5 years old
- Updated somewhat regularly (but not always promptly)
- Basic antivirus (Windows Defender or similar)

**What's also normal**:
- One or two very old computers still in use
- Inconsistent software across devices
- Not all computers on latest OS version

**Red flags**:
- Running Windows 7 or earlier (security risk)
- No antivirus or security software
- Computers regularly crashing/failing

---

### Internet and Network
**What's normal**:
- Business internet ($50-150/month)
- Router/modem from ISP
- Wi-Fi password changed from default
- Basic network setup (plug and play)

**What's also normal**:
- Router firmware never updated
- Default router admin password still in place
- No guest Wi-Fi network
- Can't remember who set up network

**Red flags**:
- Frequent internet outages
- Very slow speeds for business needs
- Still using residential internet

---

### Backup Strategy
**What's normal (but not ideal)**:
- Hosting provider "handles" website backups
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox) for files
- No formal backup testing
- "I think we have backups" uncertainty

**What's less common but better**:
- Automated daily backups
- Off-site backup storage
- Quarterly backup testing

**Red flags**:
- No backups at all
- Backups only on same server
- Haven't tested restore ever

---

### IT Support
**What's normal**:
- Break-fix IT (call when something breaks)
- OR employee who "knows computers" handles things
- OR MSP for $100-200/month
- Occasional help from website developer

**What's also normal**:
- Multiple contacts for different issues
- No single IT "person"
- Google things when problems arise

**Red flags**:
- Complete dependence on one person who's not IT professional
- No idea who to call for help
- Ignoring IT issues because "too expensive to fix"

---

## The Typical 10-25 Person Business

**Similar to 5-10 person, plus**:

### More Structure
- Dedicated IT person or contract MSP
- Some documentation (not always current)
- More consistent software across team
- Slightly better security practices

---

### Business Systems
- CRM or customer management system
- Project management tool (Asana, Monday, Trello)
- Accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero)
- Industry-specific software

---

### More Devices
- 10-25 computers
- Shared printer(s)
- Maybe a server (less common now with cloud)
- Mobile devices for key staff

---

### Security
- Firewall (usually router's built-in)
- Password policy (enforced somewhat)
- Some two-factor authentication
- Basic employee training

**Still often missing**:
- Formal security audit
- Complete DMARC configuration
- Comprehensive backup testing

---

## What's "Behind" vs. "Normal"

### You're Probably Behind If:
- No SSL certificate on website
- Using personal Gmail for business
- Computers running Windows 7 or older
- No email security configuration (SPF/DKIM)
- No backups at all
- Website frequently broken or down

---

### You're Probably Normal If:
- SSL certificate (even if it auto-renews and you don't think about it)
- Business email through Google/Microsoft or hosting
- Computers from last 5 years
- Basic email security (SPF at minimum)
- "Some kind of backups" (even if untested)
- Website mostly works

---

### You're Probably Ahead If:
- DMARC configured correctly
- Regular backup testing
- Documented IT systems
- Proactive security measures
- Emergency contact list
- IT budget planned annually

---

## What Well-Managed IT Actually Looks Like

**Not fancy. Just organized.**

### Well-Managed Looks Like:
- Domain auto-renews, expiration date documented
- Email security configured (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Daily backups that are occasionally tested
- Software reasonably current (within 1-2 major versions)
- Passwords in password manager
- Emergency contact list exists
- Someone responsible for IT (even if part-time)
- Quarterly IT review

[See actual examples](/examples) of what well-managed small business IT looks like in practice.

**Not**:
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure
- Latest/greatest technology
- Expensive monitoring systems
- Full-time IT department

**Key difference**: Documentation and proactive attention, not expensive tech.

---

## Common Gaps We See (Even in "Normal" Setups)

### Gap #1: Domain Control Unclear
**How common**: 40% of small businesses

**What it looks like**:
- Domain registered under personal email
- No one knows registrar login
- Unclear who "owns" domain

This gap often surfaces during [insurance renewals](/use-cases#insurance-renewal) when you're asked technical questions about your IT, or during [business acquisitions](/use-cases#business-acquisition) when due diligence requires proof of ownership.

**Fix**: Transfer to business control, document access

---

### Gap #2: Email Security Incomplete
**How common**: 60-80% of small businesses

**What it looks like**:
- SPF configured
- DKIM maybe configured
- DMARC completely missing

**Fix**: Configure DMARC (improves deliverability and security)

---

### Gap #3: Backup Uncertainty
**How common**: 70% of small businesses

**What it looks like**:
- "I think my host backs up the website"
- Never tested restoration
- No documentation of backup process

**Fix**: Verify backups exist, test restoration once

---

### Gap #4: No IT Documentation
**How common**: 80% of small businesses

**What it looks like**:
- No one knows where domain is registered
- Can't find hosting login
- Previous IT person left, took knowledge with them

**Fix**: 1 hour to document key systems and access. These gaps often surface during [insurance renewals](/use-cases#insurance-renewal) when you can't answer technical questions, or during [business transitions](/use-cases#business-acquisition) when buyers ask for documentation.

---

### Gap #5: Outdated Software
**How common**: 50% of small businesses

**What it looks like**:
- WordPress plugins 2+ years old
- Running old OS versions
- "If it works, don't touch it" mentality

**Fix**: Schedule quarterly updates

---

## What's NOT Normal (But Vendors Try to Sell You)

### "You NEED Enterprise-Grade Security"
**Reality**: Most small businesses don't need (and can't afford) enterprise security.

**What you actually need**: SSL, basic firewall, current software, strong passwords, two-factor auth

---

### "You NEED a Dedicated Server"
**Reality**: Most small business websites run fine on shared hosting.

**When you actually need it**: High traffic (100,000+ visitors/month) or special requirements

---

### "You NEED $5,000 Backup System"
**Reality**: Cloud backups work fine for most businesses.

**What you actually need**: Daily backups, offsite storage, occasional testing ($10-50/month)

---

### "You NEED Full-Time IT Staff"
**Reality**: Most businesses under 25 people don't need full-time IT.

**What you actually need**: Break-fix support or part-time MSP

---

## The "You're Not Behind" Checklist

Check yourself against this baseline:

☐ Website has SSL (https://) and loads  
☐ Email works reliably  
☐ Computers from last 5-7 years  
☐ Some form of backup exists  
☐ Domain won't expire unexpectedly  
☐ You know who to call for IT help  
☐ Critical files in cloud storage  

**If you checked 5-7**: You're doing fine. Room for improvement, but not behind.

**If you checked 3-4**: Normal gaps. Address top priorities.

**If you checked 0-2**: Time to invest in IT basics.

---

## What to Focus On (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Security Basics
- SSL certificate
- Email security (SPF minimum)
- Current software
- Strong passwords

**Why first**: Security issues can destroy your business

---

### Priority 2: Control and Access
- Domain control documented
- Key system access documented
- Emergency contact list

**Why second**: Loss of control is expensive to fix

---

### Priority 3: Backups
- Website backups verified
- File backups configured
- Test restoration once

**Why third**: Data loss is painful but usually doesn't happen suddenly

---

### Priority 4: Optimization
- Update outdated software
- Clean up file organization
- Improve documentation

**Why last**: Nice to have, but not urgent

---

## Bottom Line: Normal is Good Enough

**You don't need cutting-edge technology.**

**You need**:
- Systems that work reliably
- Basic security in place
- Control over your infrastructure
- Someone who knows how things are set up

**"Normal" small business IT**:
- Google Workspace or Microsoft 365
- Website on decent hosting
- Some email security
- Cloud file storage
- Break-fix or basic MSP support
- Imperfect but functional

**You're ahead if you have**: Documentation, tested backups, proactive IT attention

**You're behind if you have**: No SSL, no email security, no backups, complete IT chaos

**Most businesses fall somewhere in between.** And that's okay.

---

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
