## Key Insights

### What Makes Good Contextual Links
✅ **Natural fit**: Enhances the content, doesn't interrupt flow  
✅ **Adds value**: Gives reader more information on related topic  
✅ **Specific**: Links to exact section (e.g., `/use-cases#insurance-renewal`)  
✅ **Strategic**: Points to money pages, not just other blog posts  

### What to Avoid
❌ **Forced links**: Mentioning topics just to add links  
❌ **Too many**: More than 3-4 becomes spammy  
❌ **Generic**: "Click here" or vague link text  
❌ **Redundant**: Multiple links to same page in short span
