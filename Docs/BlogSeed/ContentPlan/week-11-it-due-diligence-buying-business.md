# IT Due Diligence When Buying a Business

You're buying a business. The financials look good. The customer list is solid. But what about the IT?

Many buyers focus on revenue, assets, and contracts — and completely overlook IT infrastructure. Then after closing, they discover:
- Domain is registered under the founder's personal email
- Website is held hostage by a contractor
- No one has the passwords
- Email is about to expire
- Critical systems are outdated and insecure

Here's what to review during IT due diligence — before you sign.

---

## Why IT Due Diligence Matters

**IT problems you inherit**:
- Domain control issues (can't access or renew)
- Website dependencies (contractor owns everything)
- Security vulnerabilities (hacked site, old software)
- Expiring services (domain, hosting, software licenses)
- Undocumented systems (no one knows how it works)
- Technical debt (expensive fixes needed immediately)

**Cost of not checking**: $5,000-$50,000+ to untangle after purchase

**Time investment for due diligence**: 4-8 hours

**ROI**: Avoid expensive surprises, negotiate better price, plan transition

## IT Due Diligence Checklist

### 1. Domain Name(s)

**Questions to ask**:
- What domains does the business own?
- Where are they registered?
- When do they expire?
- Who controls the registrar account?
- Is auto-renew enabled?

**What to verify**:
- WHOIS lookup (see who owns domain)
- Registrar account access (can seller provide login?)
- Expiration dates (are any expiring soon?)
- Domain lock status (enabled for security?)

**Red flags**:
- Domain registered under founder's personal email
- Expiration coming up (within 90 days)
- Can't provide registrar access
- Multiple domains, unclear ownership
- Domain registered with shady registrar

**What to negotiate**:
- Transfer domain to your control before/at closing
- Verify transfer is possible (not locked or in dispute)
- Price adjustment if domain issues found

---

### 2. Website and Hosting

**Questions to ask**:
- Where is website hosted?
- Who has access to hosting account?
- Who built/maintains the website?
- Are there contracts with web developers?
- When does hosting renew?
- What's the monthly/annual cost?

**What to verify**:
- Hosting control panel access (can you log in?)
- Backup existence (and ability to restore)
- Website ownership (is code under business or contractor's account?)
- Dependencies (any third-party integrations that might break?)

**Red flags**:
- Contractor "owns" the website
- No backups exist
- Hosting account under personal name
- Website was "free" (means someone else controls it)
- Critical features rely on one person's maintenance

**What to negotiate**:
- Transfer hosting account to you
- Get source code and backups
- Terminate contractor relationship (or renegotiate)
- Document all third-party integrations

---

### 3. Email System

**Questions to ask**:
- What email service? (Gmail, Outlook, custom domain email)
- How many email accounts?
- Where is email hosted? (same as website or separate?)
- Who has admin access?
- When does email service renew?
- What's the cost?

This is exactly the scenario [we built Explain My IT for](/use-cases#business-acquisition) — getting clear answers about email, domains, and IT infrastructure during acquisitions.

**What to verify**:
- Admin access to email system
- MX records (where email is actually configured)
- Email accounts list (who has accounts?)
- Storage usage (approaching limits?)

**Red flags**:
- Email through personal Gmail forwarding (not business email)
- Email hosted by contractor who won't transfer
- No one has admin access
- Years of email with no backups
- Using free email (not professional)

**What to negotiate**:
- Transfer email admin control
- Export all email archives
- Verify no personal email is mixed with business email
- Document email forwarding rules

---

### 4. Software and Licenses

**Questions to ask**:
- What software does the business use? (Accounting, CRM, etc.)
- Are licenses in company name or personal name?
- When do licenses renew?
- What's the annual software cost?
- Are there any contracts or commitments?

**What to verify**:
- Software license ownership
- Can licenses be transferred?
- Are there cancellation fees?
- Is software up to date or outdated?

**Red flags**:
- Licenses under founder's personal account
- "Pirated" or unlicensed software
- Long-term contracts with penalties
- Software is discontinued or unsupported

**What to negotiate**:
- Transfer licenses to your name
- Verify no hidden software costs
- Budget for software updates if needed
- Renegotiate contracts if transferable

---

### 5. Security Posture

**Questions to ask**:
- When was last security audit?
- Are software and systems updated?
- How are passwords managed?
- Is there two-factor authentication?
- Any known security incidents in past 2 years?

**What to verify**:
- Website SSL certificate (valid and current?)
- Software versions (outdated = security risk)
- Backups (exist and tested?)
- Access controls (who has admin access?)

**Red flags**:
- Never had security audit
- Running outdated/unsupported software
- Passwords on sticky notes or shared Google doc
- Previous security breaches (ask if site was ever hacked)
- No backups

**What to negotiate**:
- Security review before closing
- Budget for immediate security fixes
- Price adjustment for technical debt
- Require backups be provided at closing

---

### 6. Access and Credentials

**Questions to ask**:
- What systems require logins?

**What to get at closing**:
- All account logins (hosting, domain, email, software)
- Admin passwords
- Two-factor authentication codes/recovery keys
- API keys or integration credentials
- FTP/SSH access
- Database access

**Red flags**:

---

### 7. Contracts and Relationships

**Questions to ask**:
- Who provides IT support?

- What's the relationship with web developer/contractor?
- Are there any ongoing obligations?

**What to review**:
- IT support contracts (length, cost, cancellation terms)
- Web development agreements (who owns what?)
- Hosting contracts
- Software subscriptions

**Red flags**:
- Long-term contracts you don't want to honor
- Vendor relationships that will break at transfer
- "Handshake" agreements with no documentation
- Critical systems relying on one person

**What to negotiate**:
- Option to renegotiate or terminate contracts
- Documented handover from current IT support
- Transition assistance from web developer
- Clear ownership of all work products

---

### 8. Technical Debt

**Questions to ask**:
- What IT problems need fixing?
- What upgrades are pending?
- Any known issues or limitations?

**What to look for**:

- Security issues needing immediate attention
- Scalability problems (systems can't handle growth)
- Deferred maintenance

**Red flags**:
- "We've been meaning to fix that..."

## Red Flags That Should Pause the Deal

### Major Red Flags (Reconsider Purchase)
- Domain not transferable (in dispute, locked by registrar)
- Website completely dependent on uncooperative contractor
- No one has any passwords or access
- Previous undisclosed security breach
- Systems so outdated they need immediate replacement

[Example reports](/examples) show what a clean IT setup looks like vs. one with red flags that need attention before closing.

---

### Moderate Red Flags (Negotiate)
- Some access/credential issues
- Technical debt requiring investment
- Contracts that need renegotiation
- Minor security issues fixable

---

### Minor Red Flags (Fix After Purchase)
- Documentation gaps
- Suboptimal configurations
- Room for improvement but functional

---

## What to Demand at Closing

**Must-haves before signing**:
☐ Complete list of all domains, hosting, email accounts  
☐ Working credentials for all systems  
☐ Domain transfer initiated (or completed)  
☐ Backup of website and database  
☐ Email export (all mailboxes)  
☐ Software license transfers completed  
☐ Contracts and vendor relationships documented  
☐ Known issues list  

**Don't close until you have these.** Once money changes hands, leverage disappears.

---

## Post-Closing IT Checklist

## Questions to Ask Seller

### About Domain
1. "Can you show me where the domain is registered?"
2. "Is the domain in the business name or personal name?"
3. "When does it expire and is auto-renew on?"
4. "Are there any issues transferring it?"

---

### About Website
5. "Who built the website and who has the code?"
6. "Where is it hosted and can you provide access?"
7. "When was it last backed up?"
8. "Are there any dependencies on specific contractors?"

---

### About Email
9. "What email service do you use?"
10. "Can you provide admin access?"
11. "How many email accounts exist?"

---

### About IT Issues
12. "What IT problems should I be aware of?"
13. "What would you fix if you were staying?"
14. "Have you had any security incidents?"

---

## Cost of Common IT Issues Found

**Domain control issues**: $500-$5,000 to untangle

**Website contractor hostage situation**: $2,000-$10,000 to rebuild

**Hacked website**: $500-$3,000 to clean and secure

**Outdated systems**: $5,000-$50,000 to modernize

**No backups/lost data**: Priceless (potentially business-ending)

**Lesson**: 8 hours of due diligence can save $10,000+ in post-purchase problems.

---

## When to Walk Away

**Walk away if**:
- Seller won't provide access or information
- Domain can't be transferred
- Critical systems are broken/unsupportable
- Technical debt exceeds business value
- Seller is hiding IT problems

**Good deals survive due diligence.** If seller is evasive about IT, what else are they hiding?

---

## Hiring Help for IT Due Diligence

**Consider hiring an IT consultant if**:
- You're not technical
- Business is heavily IT-dependent
- Purchase price is significant
- You found red flags and need expert assessment

**Cost**: $1,000-$5,000 for thorough IT due diligence

**ROI**: Catch issues worth 10x-50x the consulting fee

---

## Bottom Line

**IT due diligence prevents expensive surprises.**

**Minimum checklist**:
1. Verify domain ownership and transferability
2. Get website access and backups
3. Verify email access
4. Get all credentials
5. Understand technical debt
6. Document everything

**Time**: 4-8 hours  
**Cost**: Minimal (or hire consultant for $1,000-5,000)  
**Savings**: $10,000-100,000+ in avoided problems

**Don't skip this.** "I didn't know" isn't an excuse after you own the business.

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
