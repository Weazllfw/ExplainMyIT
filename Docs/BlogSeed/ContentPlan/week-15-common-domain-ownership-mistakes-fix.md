# Common Domain Ownership Mistakes We See (And How to Fix Them)

Domain ownership seems straightforward: You buy a domain, you own it. Simple.

Except it's not.

We've seen hundreds of small business domain setups. And we see the same mistakes repeatedly — mistakes that don't cause problems until suddenly they do.

Here are the six most common domain ownership mistakes, what makes them risky, and how to fix them.

---

## Mistake #1: Domain Registered Under Employee's Personal Email

**How common**: 40% of small businesses

### The Scenario
Your first employee or IT person registered your domain years ago. They used their personal email as the registrar contact.

Fast forward: That person leaves. You need to renew the domain or transfer it. But the registrar sends notifications to their personal email. You can't access the account.

### Why This Happens
- Founder was too busy during startup
- IT person said "I'll handle it"
- Used personal email because it was convenient
- Nobody thought about what happens if they leave

### The Risk
- Can't access registrar account when needed
- Renewal notices go to wrong person
- Domain could expire without you knowing
- Former employee might not cooperate with transfer

### Real Example
Business owner needs to update DNS. Domain is registered under contractor's personal Gmail. Contractor moved to different country, doesn't respond to emails. Owner has to prove business ownership to registrar, takes 3 weeks and $500 in fees.

### How to Fix
1. **Find out where your domain is registered** (WHOIS lookup)
2. **Contact the person who registered it** (if still reachable)
3. **Request transfer to business email** (admin@yourbusiness.com or similar)
4. **Update registrar contact info** to current business owner
5. **Document everything** (registrar, login, renewal dates)

**Time to fix**: 1-4 hours (if person cooperates)  
**Cost**: Free to $50

**If person won't cooperate**: Contact registrar with proof of business ownership (business license, tax ID). They can usually help, but takes longer.

## Mistake #2: Former Employee or Contractor Still Controls Domain

**How common**: 30% of small businesses

### The Scenario
Your web developer or IT contractor registered your domain "for you." Technically they own it, or at least they control the registrar account. They might even be paying for it and billing you back.

Fast forward: You part ways with the contractor. Now they won't transfer the domain, or they're holding it hostage for unpaid invoices, or they've disappeared.

### Why This Happens
- Contractor said "I'll take care of everything"
- Owner trusted them completely
- Easier for contractor to manage if under their account
- Nobody clarified ownership at the start

### The Risk
- Domain ownership disputed
- Can't make changes without their cooperation
- They could hold domain ransom
- If they go out of business, domain might be lost

### Real Example
Business owner fires web developer over dispute. Developer controls domain registrar account. Refuses to transfer unless paid $5,000 "for previous work." Business owner has to hire lawyer, costs $3,000 in legal fees plus months of stress to regain control.

### How to Fix
**If relationship is still good**:
1. **Request immediate transfer** to your registrar account
2. **Get registrar login** if they won't transfer
3. **Change registrant email** to your business email
4. **Document agreement** in writing

**If relationship is bad**:
1. **Prove ownership** with business license, tax records, trademark
2. **Contact registrar directly** with ownership proof
3. **File complaint** if contractor is acting in bad faith
4. **Consider legal action** if value is high

**Time to fix**: 1 week to 3 months (depending on cooperation)  
**Cost**: $0 to $5,000+ (if legal action needed)

**Prevention**: Always register domains under your own account. Contractor can have access, but YOU should be registrant.

## Mistake #3: Auto-Renew Disabled (Without Owner Knowing)

**How common**: 25% of small businesses

### The Scenario
Auto-renew was on when domain was registered. But at some point it got turned off — maybe during a billing update, maybe the registrar changed policies, maybe someone clicked the wrong button.

You don't notice because domain isn't expiring yet. Then expiration comes, domain expires, website and email go down.

### Why This Happens
- Credit card expired and auto-renew was disabled
- Registrar billing policy changed
- Someone turned it off accidentally
- Moved domain between registrars and setting didn't transfer

### The Risk
- Domain expires without warning
- Website and email stop working
- Redemption fees ($100-200) to recover
- Potential loss of domain if not recovered quickly

### Real Example
Business domain expired. Owner didn't notice for 5 days (was on vacation). Website and email down. Had to pay $150 redemption fee to recover. Lost 5 days of business and customer trust.

### How to Fix
1. **Log into registrar NOW**
2. **Check auto-renew status** for all domains
3. **Enable auto-renew** if disabled
4. **Verify payment method** is current
5. **Set calendar reminders** 60 days before expiration (backup)

**Time to fix**: 10 minutes  
**Cost**: $0 (prevention) vs. $100-200+ (recovery if it expires)

**Pro tip**: Even with auto-renew on, set manual reminders. Auto-renew sometimes fails.

## Mistake #4: Multiple Domains, Nobody Tracking Expiration

**How common**: 20% of businesses with 3+ domains

### The Scenario
You own yourbusiness.com, yourbusiness.net, yourbusiness.org, old-business-name.com, common-misspelling.com. They're registered with different registrars over the years. Nobody is tracking when each expires.

One expires unexpectedly. Maybe it's not your main domain, but it was redirecting to your main site. Or it's your old domain that customers still use.

### Why This Happens
- Registered domains over time for different purposes
- Different people registered different domains
- No central tracking system
- "Set and forget" mentality

### The Risk
- Lose domains you still need
- Competitors or domain squatters grab expired domain
- Customers reaching old domain see error or competitor site

### Real Example
Business has 6 domains. Main domain on auto-renew, fine. But old domain that forwards to main site expired. Owner didn't notice. Competitor bought the expired domain, put up competing site. Lost traffic and customers for months before noticing. This often comes up during [business acquisitions](/use-cases#business-acquisition) when buyers ask "how many domains do you actually own?"

### How to Fix
1. **List all domains you own** (even old ones)
2. **Find which registrar hosts each** (WHOIS lookup for each)
3. **Document expiration dates** (spreadsheet or doc)
4. **Enable auto-renew on all** (even if you "might not need it")
5. **Consolidate if possible** (move all to one registrar for easier management)
6. **Set annual reminder** to review domain list

**Time to fix**: 1-2 hours (one-time setup)  
**Cost**: $0 (prevention)

## Mistake #5: Registrar Lock Not Enabled

**How common**: 60% of small businesses

### The Scenario
Registrar lock (also called "transfer lock") prevents unauthorized domain transfers. Most domains come with it disabled or owners turn it off and forget to re-enable it.

Without lock: Someone with access to your registrar account (or who hacks it) can transfer your domain to another registrar without your permission.

### Why This Happens
- Lock disabled by default
- Owner disabled it for legitimate transfer, forgot to re-enable
- Didn't know lock feature exists
- Registrar doesn't make it obvious

### The Risk
- Domain stolen via unauthorized transfer
- Requires lengthy recovery process to get back
- Website and email disrupted during recovery

### Real Example
Business owner's registrar account hacked. Attacker transferred domain to different registrar. Owner had to file complaint with ICANN, prove ownership, wait 2 weeks for domain recovery. Website down entire time.

### How to Fix
1. **Log into registrar**
2. **Find "Domain Lock" or "Transfer Lock" setting**
3. **Enable it**
4. **Verify lock status quarterly**

**Time to fix**: 5 minutes  
**Cost**: $0 (usually free security feature)

**Note**: You need to disable lock temporarily if you ever want to transfer domain legitimately. Just remember to re-enable after transfer completes.

## Mistake #6: No One Knows Registrar Login

**How common**: 35% of small businesses

### The Scenario
Domain was registered years ago. Maybe by founder, maybe by employee who left, maybe by contractor. Account login credentials lost. No one can access the registrar account to make changes, check expiration, or verify settings.

### Why This Happens
- Login was saved in someone's browser (that computer died)
- Password in old email account no longer accessible
- Person who set it up left company
- "I'll remember it" (but didn't)

### The Risk
- Can't make DNS changes when needed
- Can't verify domain settings
- Becomes critical during [MSP transitions](/use-cases#msp-transition) when you need to take control from an old contractor
- Can't update payment method
- Can't transfer domain
- Urgent issues take days/weeks to resolve

### Real Example
Business needs to update DNS for email migration. Can't find registrar login. Spend 2 days searching old emails, resetting passwords. Email migration delayed. Tried 3 different email addresses before finding right one. Wasted day of work.

### How to Fix

**If you still know the registrar**:
1. **Use password reset** with registrant email
2. **If email address also lost**, contact registrar support
3. **Prove ownership** (business license, tax ID, credit card used)
4. **Regain access** (may take 1-7 days)

**If you don't know registrar**:
1. **WHOIS lookup** on your domain (shows registrar)
2. **Contact that registrar** with ownership proof
3. **Request account recovery**

**Once you have access**:
1. **Store login in password manager** (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
2. **Update registrant email** to current business email
3. **Document registrar info** in business records
4. **Share access** with backup person

**Time to fix**: 1 hour to 1 week  
**Cost**: $0 to $50 (sometimes registrars charge for ownership verification)

## Prevention: How to Avoid These Mistakes

### When Registering New Domain
1. **Register under business email** (admin@business.com, not personal Gmail)
2. **Use business credit card** (not personal)
3. **Enable auto-renew** immediately
4. **Enable domain lock** immediately
5. **Document registrar and login** immediately

---

### When Working with Contractors
1. **You register domain** (contractor can have access but you're registrant)
2. **Never let contractor register under their account** "for convenience"
3. **Written agreement** about domain ownership
4. **Get registrar access** day one, not later

---

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. **Quarterly review**: Check expiration dates, verify auto-renew
2. **Annual audit**: Verify all domains still under your control
3. **Update documentation**: When anything changes
4. **Test access**: Can you actually log in?

---

## Cost of Fixing These Mistakes

**If caught early** (before problems):
- Time: 1-2 hours
- Cost: $0

**If caught when renewal fails**:
- Time: 1-3 days
- Cost: $100-200 redemption fees

**If domain stolen or lost**:
- Time: Weeks to months
- Cost: $500-10,000+ (recovery, legal fees, or buy-back)

**Prevention is dramatically cheaper than cure.**

---

## Bottom Line

**Domain ownership mistakes are common and invisible — until they're not.**

**The six mistakes**:
1. Registered under employee personal email
2. Contractor controls domain
3. Auto-renew disabled
4. Multiple domains, no tracking
5. No registrar lock
6. Lost registrar login

**The fix**: 90-minute audit now to verify and document everything

**The prevention**: Use business email, enable auto-renew and lock, document access, review quarterly. [Monthly verification](/why-monthly) ensures domain settings don't change without your knowledge and catches issues before they become emergencies.

**If you fix nothing else this year, fix your domain control.** It's your business's digital foundation.

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
