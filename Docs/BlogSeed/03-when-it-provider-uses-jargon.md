# What to Do When Your IT Provider Uses Words You Don't Understand

The meeting was supposed to clarify your IT setup. Instead, you're hearing about DNS propagation, SSL handshakes, SPF records, and nameserver configurations. You nod along because stopping to ask what everything means would make the meeting three times longer. But when it's over, you still don't actually understand your IT setup - you just have more technical terms bouncing around your head.

Sound familiar?

## The Jargon Problem

IT professionals aren't trying to confuse you (usually). They're using the language they use with each other. The problem is that this language wasn't designed for business owners - it was designed for technical precision between technical people.

When your IT person says "We need to update the A record in your DNS," they know exactly what that means. You hear "We need to update the [something] record in your [something else]."

And because you don't want to seem incompetent, you say "okay, go ahead" without understanding what's changing or why it matters to your business.

This creates a dangerous dynamic: you're making decisions about your business's IT infrastructure without actually understanding what's being changed, why it's necessary, or what the implications are.

## Why "Just Trust Them" Isn't Enough

"But I'm not technical - I should just trust the experts."

Trust is important. But blind trust is dangerous.

You don't need to be a mechanic to understand "your brakes are worn and need replacing" or "your oil needs changing." Your mechanic can explain these things in terms you understand - what the problem is, what happens if you don't fix it, and what they're recommending.

Your IT provider should be able to do the same.

If they can't explain what they're doing in language you understand, one of two things is true:
1. They don't actually understand it well enough to explain it simply
2. They don't think it's worth their time to explain it to you

Neither is good.

## The Translation You Need

You don't need to learn what a "CNAME record" is. You need your IT person to translate technical actions into business implications.

**Technical:** "We're updating your SPF record to include the new email server."

**Business translation:** "We're updating your email security settings to include the new server we're moving you to. This prevents your emails from being flagged as spam."

**Technical:** "The SSL certificate is going to expire next month."

**Business translation:** "The security certificate for your website needs renewing. If it expires, visitors will see security warnings when they try to visit your site."

**Technical:** "We need to modify the MX records for your domain."

**Business translation:** "We're changing where your email gets delivered. You'll notice no difference, but it needs to happen for the migration to work."

See the difference? Same information, but one version tells you what it means for your business.

## The Questions You Should Always Ask

When your IT provider uses a term you don't understand, or proposes something technical, ask these questions:

### "What does that mean in practice?"

Don't ask for a technical definition. Ask what it actually means for your business.

**Not:** "What's DNS?"  
**Instead:** "What does DNS do for my business, and why does this change matter?"

**Not:** "What's an SSL certificate?"  
**Instead:** "How does this affect my customers, and what happens if we don't have one?"

### "What happens if we don't do this?"

This separates urgent necessities from nice-to-haves.

**Critical:** "Your website will stop working."  
**Important:** "Your emails might get flagged as spam."  
**Nice to have:** "Your website will load slightly faster."

Understanding the consequences helps you make informed decisions about priorities and budget.

### "How will I know if something goes wrong?"

Technical changes can have unintended side effects.

**Good answer:** "I'll test it first, and I'll monitor for issues. If anything goes wrong, you'll get an alert, and I'll fix it."

**Concerning answer:** "It should be fine."

You're not being difficult - you're asking reasonable questions about your business.

### "Can you show me what's changing?"

Sometimes seeing is clearer than hearing.

Ask them to show you:
- What the before and after looks like
- Where this lives in your accounts
- What would change for your customers or employees

Visual demonstrations often make technical concepts clearer than verbal explanations.

## Common IT Terms, Translated

Here are common terms you'll hear, and what they actually mean for your business:

**DNS (Domain Name System)**  
*What it is:* The system that connects your domain name to your website and email servers.  
*Why it matters:* If DNS is misconfigured, people can't reach your website or send you email.  
*Business translation:* "The phone book that tells the internet where to find your business."

**SSL Certificate**  
*What it is:* Encryption that secures the connection between visitors and your website.  
*Why it matters:* Without it, browsers show security warnings, and your site looks untrustworthy.  
*Business translation:* "The padlock in the browser address bar that tells customers your site is secure."

**SPF/DKIM/DMARC**  
*What it is:* Email authentication that proves emails from your domain are legitimate.  
*Why it matters:* Without these, others can more easily impersonate your business via email, and your legitimate emails might be flagged as spam.  
*Business translation:* "Email security that prevents spammers from pretending to be you."

**Backup / Backup Rotation**  
*What it is:* Copies of your data stored separately from your main systems.  
*Why it matters:* If something breaks, gets hacked, or is deleted, you can restore from backups.  
*Business translation:* "Insurance copies of your website, database, and files."

**Firewall**  
*What it is:* Security that blocks unauthorized access to your systems.  
*Why it matters:* First line of defense against attacks.  
*Business translation:* "Security guard that decides who can and can't access your systems."

**Hosting / Server**  
*What it is:* Where your website, email, or applications actually run.  
*Why it matters:* If hosting goes down, so does whatever's hosted there.  
*Business translation:* "The building where your digital stuff lives."

## Red Flags in IT Communication

These are signs that your IT provider might not be communicating effectively:

**"You wouldn't understand the technical details"**  
Translation: "I don't want to take the time to explain this."  
Response: "Try me. I need to understand what's changing with my business."

**"This is standard practice"**  
Translation: "I don't want to justify this decision."  
Response: "I'm sure it is. Can you explain why it's standard and what it does?"

**"Just trust me on this"**  
Translation: "I don't want to explain my reasoning."  
Response: "I do trust your expertise. I also need to understand what I'm approving."

**Using acronyms without defining them**  
Translation: "I'm not thinking about my audience."  
Response: "Can you explain what [acronym] means and why it matters?"

**"It's too complicated to explain"**  
Translation: "I either don't understand it fully myself, or I don't want to invest the time."  
Response: "Can you give me the high-level business impact? I don't need all the technical details, but I need to understand what's changing."

## How to Set Communication Expectations

Have a direct conversation with your IT provider about how you need them to communicate:

**"I need you to explain things in business terms, not technical terms. I don't need to understand how something works technically - I need to understand what it means for my business and my customers."**

**"When you're proposing a change, I need to know: what's changing, why it's necessary, what happens if we don't do it, and what could go wrong."**

**"If I ask you to explain something differently, it's not because I doubt your expertise - it's because I need to understand it well enough to make an informed decision."**

**"I expect you to translate technical jargon into language I can understand. That's part of the service I'm paying for."**

This isn't unreasonable. This is you being a good business owner.

## When to Push Back

You should push back when:

**You're being asked to approve something you don't understand**  
Don't say yes to changes you don't actually understand. It's your business.

**Explanations are circular or evasive**  
"We need to update the DNS because the nameservers are changing" doesn't actually explain anything.

**Technical work isn't documented in plain English**  
You should receive documentation you can actually read, not just technical logs.

**You're made to feel stupid for asking questions**  
Good IT providers welcome questions. They know clear communication prevents problems.

## The Documentation You Deserve

After any significant IT work, you should receive documentation that includes:

**What was done** (in business language)  
Not: "Updated A and CNAME records for subdomain propagation"  
But: "Pointed your subdomain to the new server location"

**Why it was necessary**  
"This was part of moving your email to the new provider, so your email continues working."

**What to expect**  
"You shouldn't notice any difference. If you do see issues, here's how to reach me."

**What changed** (with before/after if helpful)  
Screenshots, lists of what's different, what stayed the same.

This documentation isn't just for you - it's for the next IT person who works on your systems and needs to understand what was done and why.

## The Conversation Script

When your IT provider is using jargon, here's what to say:

**"I want to understand this, but I need you to explain it differently. Can you tell me what this means for my business, without the technical terms?"**

If they keep using jargon:

**"Let me stop you there. I'm not following. Can you explain what [term] means and why it matters to my business?"**

If they seem frustrated:

**"I know this is basic for you, but it's not my area of expertise. I need to understand what I'm approving. Can you walk me through it in business terms?"**

You're not being difficult. You're being responsible.

## When to Consider Changing Providers

If your IT provider consistently:
- Can't or won't explain things in language you understand
- Makes you feel stupid for asking questions
- Dismisses your need to understand what's happening with your business
- Hides behind jargon instead of communicating clearly

...then they're not the right fit. Technical competence matters, but so does communication. You need both.

## The Bottom Line

You're not technical, and that's fine. Your IT provider's job isn't just to implement technical solutions - it's to help you understand your IT well enough to make informed business decisions.

Nodding along when you don't understand isn't protecting your business. It's accepting risk you can't see.

You have the right to:
- Understand what's being done with your business's IT
- Ask questions until you actually understand
- Expect explanations in language you can comprehend
- Make informed decisions, not blind approvals

The right IT provider will welcome these expectations. They'll see clear communication as part of good service, not an annoying burden.

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
