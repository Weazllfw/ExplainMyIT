# I Just Inherited My Company's IT Setup - What Do I Actually Have?

You've taken over a business. Maybe you bought it, maybe you inherited it from family, or maybe the founder retired and handed you the keys. Along with the physical assets, customer lists, and financial records, you got... the IT.

You have logins. You have passwords (hopefully). You have vague assurances from the previous owner that "everything works" and "the IT guy handles it." But what do you actually have?

## The Uncomfortable Reality

Most business owners who inherit a company's IT setup are in the same position: they know enough to be concerned, but not enough to be confident.

You might be dealing with:
- Email accounts you can access, but don't know how they're configured
- A website that's running, but you're not sure where it's hosted
- A domain name that's registered somewhere, but you're not sure where
- Cloud services with active subscriptions, but unclear who has access
- Security measures that may or may not be in place

The previous owner might have been meticulous about documentation. More often, they kept it all in their head, assuming they'd always be around to handle it.

## Why "It Works" Isn't Enough

When you take over a business, "it works" is the bare minimum. You need to know:

**What you have**: The actual components of your IT setup - domains, hosting, email, security configurations, cloud services.

**Where it lives**: Which services are you paying for? Where are accounts registered? Who controls access?

**How it's configured**: Is your email security actually set up? Is your SSL certificate valid? Are your DNS records pointing to the right place?

**Who can access it**: Which employees, contractors, or vendors have admin access to critical systems?

**What could break**: What happens when domains need renewing? When certificates expire? When the "IT guy" who knows everything leaves?

## The IT Handover That Usually Doesn't Happen

In an ideal world, business succession includes a comprehensive IT handover:
- Complete documentation of all systems
- Transfer of all admin accounts
- Explanation of how everything works
- Introduction to all service providers
- Walkthrough of maintenance needs

In reality, you often get:
- A spreadsheet with some passwords (if you're lucky)
- "It all just runs" reassurance
- The previous IT person's contact info (maybe)
- A vague sense that you should "probably check this stuff eventually"

## What You Actually Need to Know

You don't need to become a system administrator. You need to understand your IT from a business owner's perspective.

### Your Domain

Your domain name is your digital real estate. You need to know:
- **Where it's registered**: Which company holds your domain (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
- **Who controls it**: Whose account is it registered under?
- **When it expires**: When does it need renewing? (Missing this can take your business offline)
- **Who can modify it**: Who has the power to change where it points?

If the domain is registered under the previous owner's personal account, that's a problem. If nobody knows when it expires, that's a problem. If the only person who can access it just left the company, that's definitely a problem.

### Your Email

Email is often more critical than your website. You need to know:
- **Where it's hosted**: Microsoft 365? Google Workspace? Private hosting?
- **How it's secured**: Is SPF/DKIM/DMARC actually set up, or just claimed to be?
- **Who has admin access**: Who can create accounts, reset passwords, or read all emails?
- **What the backup plan is**: If email goes down, what happens?

### Your Website & Hosting

Your website might "just work," but you need to know:
- **Where it's hosted**: Which hosting company? Which plan?
- **Who can modify it**: Who has FTP access, admin credentials, or deployment rights?
- **SSL certificate status**: Is your site actually secure, or showing warnings?
- **Renewal dates**: When do hosting, SSL, or related services need renewing?

### Your Security Setup

This is where "it works" really isn't enough. You need to understand:
- **What's actually in place**: Real security measures vs. assumptions
- **Who configured it**: And can they explain it if something breaks?
- **What's monitoring it**: Is anyone watching for problems?
- **What the recovery plan is**: If something gets compromised, what happens?

## The First 30 Days: Your IT Discovery Process

### Week 1: Gather What You Have

Start with the basics:
- Collect all logins and passwords
- List all services you're paying for (check credit card statements)
- Identify all email accounts and who has access
- Find domain registration details
- Locate hosting account information

Don't try to understand it all yet. Just gather the information.

### Week 2: Verify Access

Try to actually log in to everything:
- Domain registrar account
- Hosting control panel
- Email administration
- Any cloud services
- Website backend

If you can't log in, that's an immediate priority to fix. You can't manage what you can't access.

### Week 3: Get a Baseline

Before you start changing things, understand what you have right now:
- What's your current DNS configuration?
- How is email actually set up?
- What's the status of your SSL certificate?
- Where is everything hosted?
- What security measures are (or aren't) in place?

This baseline becomes your reference point. When something changes (planned or not), you'll know what changed from this point.

### Week 4: Identify Risks

Now that you know what you have, identify what could go wrong:
- What expires soon?
- What depends on people who are leaving or have left?
- What's registered under someone else's name?
- What's configured in a way you don't understand?
- What has no backup or recovery plan?

These become your priority list.

## Common Surprises New Owners Find

**The domain is registered under the founder's personal email** - and they've moved on and aren't checking that email anymore. This often becomes a critical issue during [business acquisitions](/use-cases#business-acquisition) when ownership needs to transfer.

**Email security isn't actually configured** - it's just claimed to be, but nobody ever set up SPF, DKIM, or DMARC.

**The SSL certificate expired months ago** - but the site still works, so nobody noticed it's showing security warnings.

**The "IT guy" isn't actually an employee** - they're a contractor who helped set things up years ago and occasionally fixes things, but has no documentation and is the only one who knows how it all works.

**Nobody knows where things are hosted** - the website is running, but finding the hosting account to renew or modify it requires detective work.

**Critical services are about to expire** - and the previous owner's credit card that was auto-paying them was just canceled.

## Questions to Ask (And Actually Get Answers To)

Don't accept "it's all handled" as an answer. Ask specific questions:

**About the domain:**
- Where is it registered?
- Whose account?
- When does it expire?
- Who has access to change it?

**About email:**
- Where is it hosted?
- What security measures are configured?
- Who has admin access?
- How are new accounts created?

**About the website:**
- Where is it hosted?
- Who can access the backend?
- When was it last updated?
- What happens if it goes down?

**About security:**
- What measures are in place?
- Who configured them?
- How do we know they're working?
- What's the plan if something goes wrong?

## The Documentation You Need to Create

Even if the previous owner left none, you need to create:

**Asset inventory**: Every IT asset you have - domains, hosting, email, cloud services, software subscriptions.

**Access documentation**: Who has access to what, and how to grant or revoke access.

**Configuration notes**: How things are set up, in language you can understand.

**Renewal calendar**: When things expire and need action.

**Vendor contacts**: Who to call when something breaks or needs changing.

You don't need technical manuals. You need business owner documentation that lets you make informed decisions.

## When to Get Help

You don't need to understand everything yourself. But you do need to know enough to:
- Ask the right questions
- Verify you're getting straight answers
- Make informed decisions about what to prioritize
- Know when something is urgent vs. can wait

Get help from IT professionals. But as the business owner, you need enough understanding to manage them effectively, not blind trust that "it's all handled."

## The First Thing to Do

Before you dive into understanding DNS records or SSL certificates or email authentication protocols, start with something simpler:

**Get a clear snapshot of what you have right now.**

Not what you think you have. Not what you were told you have. What you actually have, as of today.

That baseline gives you:
- A starting point for understanding your setup
- A reference for spotting changes
- Documentation you can show to IT providers
- Evidence for [insurance renewals](/use-cases#insurance-renewal) or compliance needs
- Confidence that you know what you're working with

Think of it like a property survey when you buy a building. You need to know what's actually there before you can manage, maintain, or improve it.

## The Bottom Line

Inheriting a company's IT setup is like inheriting a house where the previous owner did their own electrical work. It might be fine. It might be a mess. You won't know until you actually look.

You don't need to become an electrician. But you do need to know enough to:
- Understand what you have
- Identify what needs attention
- Ask informed questions
- Make sound decisions

Start with understanding, not fixing. You can't fix what you don't understand, and you can't understand what you can't see.

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
