# What Your Domain Registrar Actually Does (And Why It Matters)

Your business owns a domain name - something like "yourcompany.com." But where does that domain actually live? Who controls it? And what happens if you don't renew it?

The answer lies with your domain registrar - the company where your domain is registered. Understanding what they do and ensuring you control your domain is more important than most business owners realize.

## What Domain Registrars Actually Do

Think of your domain name as digital real estate. The domain registrar is like the land registry office.

**They don't own your domain** - you do (as long as you keep paying for it).

**But they maintain the official record** that says:
- You own this domain
- It expires on [date]
- Here's where it points (DNS records)
- Here's who can make changes to it

The registrar is essentially the gatekeeper. They're the official record-keeper that the internet trusts.

## Common Registrars

You've probably heard of some:
- GoDaddy
- Namecheap
- Google Domains (now Squarespace Domains)
- Cloudflare
- Name.com
- Hover

Any of these can register and manage your domain. They all do the same basic thing - they register your domain and give you control over it.

## What You're Actually Paying For

When you pay for domain registration, you're paying for:

**The right to use that domain** for a specified period (usually 1 year at a time).

**Access to manage it** - change where it points, update contact info, configure settings.

**Renewal rights** - as long as you keep paying, the domain remains yours.

**Registrar services** - their interface for managing your domain, support, security features.

You don't own the domain forever. You lease it for a period of time, with the option to renew indefinitely.

## Why Domain Control Matters

Your domain is your business's identity online. Everything connects to it:
- Your website (yourcompany.com)
- Your email (you@yourcompany.com)
- Subdomains (shop.yourcompany.com, support.yourcompany.com)

If you lose control of your domain:
- Your website disappears
- Your email stops working
- Everything connected to that domain breaks

This can happen if:
- You forget to renew it
- Someone else gains access to your registrar account
- Your domain is registered under someone else's control
- You can't access your registrar account when you need to

## The Control Problem

Here's a common scenario that causes problems:

Your IT person or web designer registered your domain for you. They meant well - they were setting things up, and it was convenient to register it under their account.

Years later:
- They're no longer working with you
- Or they still are, but only they can access the registrar account
- Or the domain is registered under their personal email
- Or nobody remembers where it was registered

Now you need to make changes to your domain, but you can't because you don't actually control it.

**The rule:** Your business's domain should be registered in your company's name, in an account your business controls.

Not under your IT person's account. Not under the web designer's account. Your account.

## How to Check Who Controls Your Domain

**Step 1: Find out where it's registered**

Go to a WHOIS lookup service (like who.is) and search for your domain. It will show you:
- Which registrar it's registered with
- When it expires
- Sometimes contact information (often privacy-protected)

**Step 2: Try to log in**

Go to that registrar's website and try to log in. Do you:
- Have the login credentials?
- Have access to the email address associated with the account?
- Know who set up the account?

If you can't log in to your registrar account, you don't control your domain - someone else does.

**Step 3: Check who the account belongs to**

Is the registrar account:
- Under your business's name and email?
- Under a personal account of someone who no longer works there?
- Under your IT provider's account?
- Under someone's personal email?

## The Expiration Risk

Domains expire. Usually annually. When they expire:

**Day 1-30:** Grace period. The domain still works, but you can't make changes without renewing.

**Day 30-60:** Redemption period. The domain stops working, but you can still recover it (usually for a higher fee).

**After 60-75 days:** The domain is released and anyone can register it.

If you don't renew your domain, someone else can grab it. At that point, you've lost your business's identity.

**Real scenario:**
- Domain expires because payment method on file was old
- Nobody noticed because the renewal email went to an old address
- A competitor (or domain squatter) registers it immediately
- Now they want $10,000 to sell it back to you

This happens more often than you'd think.

## Auto-Renewal: Good and Bad

Most registrars offer auto-renewal. This is generally good - your domain automatically renews before expiration.

**But auto-renewal fails if:**
- The payment method expires or is declined
- The renewal email isn't being monitored
- Someone turned off auto-renewal without telling you
- There's a billing issue with the registrar

Don't rely entirely on auto-renewal. Know:
- When your domain expires
- What payment method is on file
- Where renewal notifications are sent
- Who's responsible for monitoring this

## Domain Transfers

If you need to transfer your domain to a different registrar (or to your control from someone else's account), there's a process:

1. Unlock the domain at the current registrar
2. Get an authorization code (EPP code)
3. Initiate transfer at the new registrar
4. Confirm the transfer via email
5. Wait 5-7 days for transfer to complete

This is normal and safe. But you need:
- Access to the current registrar account
- Access to the administrative email address
- The domain to not be locked or within 60 days of previous transfer

If you don't control the current account, you can't easily transfer it. This is why initial control matters so much.

## DNS Management vs. Domain Registration

Confusing but important: your domain registrar and your DNS provider can be different.

**Domain Registrar:** Where your domain is registered (the official record-keeper)

**DNS Provider:** Where your DNS records are managed (where your domain points)

Often these are the same company. But not always.

**Example:**
- Domain registered with Namecheap
- DNS managed by Cloudflare
- Website hosted at Vercel
- Email at Google Workspace

All different services, working together through DNS. But your domain registrar is still the one with ultimate control.

## Security: Registrar Lock and 2FA

Two critical security features:

**Registrar Lock**  
Prevents your domain from being transferred without explicit unlocking. This stops someone from stealing your domain by transferring it to another registrar. Your domain should have registrar lock enabled.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
Requires a code from your phone in addition to password to log in. This prevents someone from accessing your account even if they get your password. Your registrar account should have 2FA enabled.

Check both of these. They're the difference between a secure domain and one that can be stolen.

## Privacy Protection

When you register a domain, your contact information (name, address, email, phone) becomes part of the public WHOIS record.

**Domain privacy** (sometimes called WHOIS privacy) hides this information, showing the registrar's contact info instead.

**Pros:**
- Reduces spam
- Hides personal information
- Looks more professional

**Cons:**
- Small additional cost (many registrars include it free)
- Can complicate domain verification for some services

Most businesses should use domain privacy. It's a simple way to keep your personal contact info private.

## Multiple Domains

Many businesses own several domains:
- Main domain (yourcompany.com)
- Common misspellings (yurcompany.com)
- Different TLDs (.net, .org, .co)
- Product or campaign domains

All of these should be:
- Registered at the same registrar (easier to manage)
- Under the same account
- Set to auto-renew
- Properly documented

Don't let secondary domains expire just because you forgot about them. Someone will grab them and try to sell them back to you.

## What to Ask Your IT Provider

If you're not sure about your domain situation, ask:

**"Where is our domain registered?"**  
They should know immediately and be able to show you.

**"Can I access that account?"**  
You should have login credentials.

**"When does our domain expire?"**  
And is auto-renewal set up and working?

**"Who owns the registrar account - us or you?"**  
It should be your business's account.

**"Is registrar lock enabled? Is 2FA enabled?"**  
Both should be yes.

## Fixing Control Issues

If you discover your domain is registered under someone else's account:

**If they're cooperative:**
1. Ask them to transfer the domain to an account you control
2. Create your own registrar account if needed
3. Initiate the transfer process
4. Verify it completes

**If they're not cooperative:**
Follow your registrar's dispute resolution process. This is messy, time-consuming, and why you should verify control before problems arise.

**Prevention:**
Set up your own registrar account from the start, and have your IT provider manage the domain within your account, not theirs.

## The Bottom Line

Your domain registrar is the gatekeeper to your business's online identity. You need to:
- Know where your domain is registered
- Have access to that account
- Verify the account is under your business's control
- Enable security features (registrar lock, 2FA)
- Know when your domain expires
- Monitor that renewal is working

Your domain should be one of the most protected assets in your business. It's your identity. Don't let someone else control it, and don't let it expire.

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.

Explain My IT exists to create a dated, owner-readable record of what's visible from the outside — so you don't have to reconstruct this later.
