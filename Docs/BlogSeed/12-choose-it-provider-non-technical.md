# How to Choose an IT Provider When You're Not Technical

You need IT help. Maybe your current provider isn't working out, or you're handling IT yourself and it's become overwhelming, or you're starting fresh and need someone competent.

But here's the problem: you're not technical. How do you evaluate IT providers when you can't judge their technical competence directly?

The answer: you don't evaluate purely on technical skills. You evaluate on how they work with non-technical business owners like you.

## What You're Actually Hiring For

You're not hiring someone to impress you with technical knowledge. You're hiring someone to:

**Explain things clearly**  
In language you understand, not jargon.

**Be proactive**  
Identify and address issues before they become problems.

**Document properly**  
So you're not dependent solely on them.

**Communicate effectively**  
Respond promptly, keep you informed, set appropriate expectations.

**Respect your time and budget**  
Recommend solutions appropriate for your business size and needs.

**Make you feel informed, not stupid**  
You should understand what they're doing and why.

Technical competence matters. But technical competence without good communication and business sense isn't valuable to you.

## Red Flags in Initial Conversations

How providers talk to you before you hire them tells you how they'll work with you after.

**They overwhelm you with jargon**  
If they can't explain their services in plain English during sales, they won't do it during service.

**They dismiss your questions**  
"Don't worry about the technical details" or "You wouldn't understand" means they don't respect your need to be informed.

**They push solutions without understanding your business**  
If they're recommending specific tools before asking about your needs, they're selling products, not solving problems.

**They can't explain pricing clearly**  
If you can't understand what you're paying for and why, that's a problem.

**They make everything sound urgent**  
Some things are urgent. Not everything. Constant urgency is often a sales tactic.

**They badmouth your current setup without details**  
"Everything you have is wrong" without specific reasons is a red flag.

**They promise things that sound too good**  
"We'll handle everything and you'll never think about IT again" is overselling. You should be informed, not completely hands-off.

## Green Flags: What Good Looks Like

**They ask questions about your business**  
Before recommending anything, they want to understand your needs, budget, and situation.

**They explain things in business terms**  
They translate technical concepts into business impacts you can understand.

**They're specific about what they will and won't do**  
Clear scope means clear expectations.

**They have a documented process**  
They can describe how they'll work with you, not just "we'll handle it."

**They're honest about limitations**  
"That's outside my expertise" or "That's not the best use of your budget" shows integrity.

**They provide references you can check**  
And those references are businesses similar to yours.

**Their pricing is transparent**  
You understand what you're paying for and can budget appropriately.

## Questions to Ask Potential Providers

Don't let the provider control the entire conversation. Ask your own questions:

### About Communication

**"How do you explain technical issues to non-technical business owners?"**  
Ask them to demonstrate. Pick something technical and ask them to explain it. Their explanation tells you a lot.

**"How quickly do you typically respond to issues?"**  
What's their response time SLA? How do they prioritize urgent vs. non-urgent issues?

**"How do you keep clients informed about ongoing work?"**  
Do they provide updates? Documentation? Reports?

**"What happens if I don't understand something you're explaining?"**  
Their answer should be "I explain it differently until you do," not "You don't need to understand the technical details."

### About Their Approach

**"What's your process for onboarding a new client?"**  
They should have a documented process, not "we'll figure it out as we go."

**"How do you document the work you do?"**  
You should receive documentation you can understand, not just technical logs.

**"Do you have clients similar to my business size/type?"**  
A provider experienced with Fortune 500 companies might not be right for a small business, and vice versa.

**"How do you handle knowledge transfer if our relationship ends?"**  
A good provider makes sure you're not stranded if you part ways.

### About Technical Practices

**"How do you approach security for a business my size?"**  
They should describe appropriate security, not overkill or under-protection.

**"What's your backup and disaster recovery approach?"**  
They should have strong opinions on backups and be able to explain them.

**"How do you stay current with technology changes?"**  
Technology evolves. Good providers keep learning.

**"Can you give me an example of a problem you solved for a client similar to me?"**  
Real examples beat vague promises.

### About Business Relationship

**"What are your rates, and how do you bill?"**  
Hourly? Fixed fee? Retainer? What's included and what's extra?

**"What's the contract term and cancellation policy?"**  
Are you locked in for years, or can you leave if it's not working?

**"Who would be my main contact?"**  
Will you work with the person you're talking to, or will they hand you off to someone else?

**"What are your guarantees or SLAs?"**  
What can you expect, and what happens if they don't deliver?

## Checking References

Ask for references from businesses similar to yours. When you contact references, ask:

**"How do they communicate? Can you understand what they're telling you?"**  
This matters more than technical expertise alone.

**"How responsive are they when you have issues?"**  
Response time matters, especially for urgent problems.

**"Do you feel they're proactive or reactive?"**  
Do they catch issues before they become problems, or only fix things after they break?

**"Do you understand what you're paying for?"**  
Are costs clear and justified, or full of surprises?

**"Would you hire them again?"**  
The ultimate question.

## The Trial Period Approach

Consider starting with a limited engagement before committing long-term:

**Option 1: Audit project**  
Hire them to audit your current IT setup. See how they work, how they communicate, what they find, and how they present it. [See examples](/examples) of what comprehensive IT audits should include.

**Option 2: Specific project**  
Hire them for a specific, bounded project. Evaluate the experience before committing to ongoing support.

**Option 3: Short-term contract**  
Start with 3-6 months instead of an annual commitment. Evaluate the relationship before extending.

This lets you assess the fit without betting your business on someone untested.

## Pricing Models: What to Expect

IT providers typically charge in one of these ways:

**Hourly**  
- Pay for time worked
- Good for occasional needs
- Can be unpredictable cost
- Make sure you understand hourly rates for different types of work

**Monthly retainer**  
- Fixed monthly fee for defined services
- Predictable budgeting
- Usually includes specific hours or scope
- Clarify what's included and what's extra

**Per-user or per-device**  
- Common for managed services
- Scales with business size
- Understand exactly what's covered per user/device

**Project-based**  
- Fixed price for specific projects
- Good for defined scope work
- Get detailed scope to avoid "that wasn't included" disputes

**Hybrid**  
- Combination of retainer + hourly for extras
- Common approach
- Make sure you understand what falls under retainer vs. billable hours

**No model is inherently better.** What matters is that you understand what you're paying for and can budget appropriately.

## Warning Signs After Hiring

Even if the initial engagement went well, watch for these signs:

**Communication degrades**  
They were responsive during sales, now they're hard to reach.

**Scope creep**  
Everything is an "extra" that costs more, even things you thought were included.

**You're kept in the dark**  
They do work but don't explain what or why, and you don't understand your own infrastructure.

**Issues keep recurring**  
They fix symptoms but never address root causes.

**They make you feel stupid**  
Questions are dismissed, explanations are condescending, you feel like a burden.

**No documentation**  
After months, you still don't have clear documentation of your setup.

**They're impossible to leave**  
Everything is set up under their accounts, and they make it difficult to transition away.

If you're seeing these, address them directly. If they don't improve, consider changing providers.

## The Size Match

Provider size should match business size:

**Solo consultant**  
- Good for small businesses
- Personal attention
- Potential availability concerns if they're sick/busy
- Make sure they have backup support

**Small firm (2-10 people)**  
- Good for small to medium businesses
- Mix of personal service and team backup
- Verify they have expertise across needed areas

**Large managed services provider**  
- Good for larger businesses
- Lots of resources and coverage
- May feel impersonal
- Often overkill for very small businesses

**The freelance developer who "also does IT"**  
- Might be great at development, less so at IT support
- Make sure IT is actually their expertise, not a side service

## The Transition: Changing Providers

If you're switching from another provider:

**Ask how they handle transitions**  
Good providers have a process for taking over from previous providers.

**Expect some discovery**  
They'll need time to understand your current setup.

**Get documentation**  
They should document your setup as they learn it.

**Expect some "oh, we found issues"**  
New providers often find problems the old provider missed. But watch for excessive badmouthing - they might be overselling.

**Verify they can actually access everything**  
Make sure domains, hosting, etc. are transferred to accounts you control, not from one provider's control to another's.

## The Essential Questions About Control

These are critical, regardless of provider:

**"Will our domain be registered under our account or yours?"**  
Answer should be: yours.

**"Will we have access to all our accounts, or only through you?"**  
Answer should be: you'll have access, they'll manage on your behalf.

**"If our relationship ends, what's the transition process?"**  
They should have a clear plan for smooth handover.

**"What documentation will we receive?"**  
You should get clear documentation of your setup in language you can understand.

You're hiring expertise, not outsourcing control. You should always have access to and ownership of your business's IT assets.

## The Bottom Line

Choosing an IT provider when you're not technical means evaluating:
- How they communicate with non-technical people
- Whether they respect your need to understand
- If they're proactive or reactive
- Whether they document properly
- If their pricing is transparent
- Whether they're right-sized for your business
- If they keep you in control of your assets

Technical expertise matters, but it's table stakes. What distinguishes good providers from mediocre ones is how they work with you.

Trust your gut. If something feels off in initial conversations, it will likely be worse after you've hired them.

And remember: you're the customer. You're hiring expertise, not abdicating responsibility. A good provider will make you more informed and confident about your IT, not more confused and dependent.

**Many owners only realize these gaps after something changes** — a vendor leaves, a certificate expires, or an insurance renewal asks unexpected questions.
